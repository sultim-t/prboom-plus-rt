<h3>Part I Linedef Types</h3>
<hr>

<a name="terms">&nbsp;</a>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
<b>Section 0. Terminology</b>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
<br>
In BOOM actions are caused to happen in the game thru linedef
types. BOOM has three kinds of linedef types:<br>
<ul>
<li> Regular - the linedef types that were already in DOOM II v1.9
<li> Extended - linedef types not in DOOM II v1.9 but less than 8192 in value
<li> Generalized - linedef types over 8192 in value that contain bit
     fields that independently control the actions of the sector
     affected.
</ul>

A linedef with non-zero linedef type is called a linedef trigger.
A linedef trigger is always activated in one of three ways -
pushing on the first sidedef of the linedef, walking over the
linedef, or shooting the linedef with an impact weapon (fists,
chainsaw, pistol, shotgun, double barreled, or chaingun). <br>
<br>
Linedefs activated by pushing on them come in two varieties. A
manual linedef affects the sector on the second sidedef of the
line pushed. A switched linedef affects all sectors that have the
same tag field as the linedef that was pushed.<br>
<br>
Nearly all switched, walkover, and gun linedefs operate on the
sectors with the same tag as that in the tag field of the
linedef.<br>
<br>
Some linedefs are never activated per se, but simply create or
control an effect thru their existence and properties, usually
affecting the sectors sharing the linedef's tags. There are also
a few special case like line-line teleporters and exit linedefs
that do not affect sectors.<br>
<br>
Some linedefs are only triggerable once, others are triggerable
as many times as you like.<br>
<br>
Triggering types are denoted by the letters P, S, W, and G for
manual(push), switched, walkover, and gun. Their retriggerability
is denoted by a 1 or R following the letter. So the triggering
types for linedefs are:<br>
<br>
<pre>
P1 PR S1 SR W1 WR G1 GR
</pre>

Often linedef actions depend on values in neighboring sectors. A
neighboring sector is one that shares a linedef in common, just
sharing a vertex is not sufficient.<br>
<br>
In DOOM only one action on a sector could occur at a time. BOOM
supports one floor action, one ceiling action, and one lighting
action simultaneously.<br>

<hr width="75%" align="left">
<b>Section 1. Doors</b>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
A door is a sector, usually placed between two rooms, whose
ceiling raises to open, and lowers to close. <br>
<br>
A door is fully closed when its ceiling height is equal to its
floor height. <br>
<br>
A door is fully open when its ceiling height is 4 less than the
lowest neighbor ceiling adjacent to it. <br>
<br>
A door may be set to an intermediate state initially, or thru the
action of a linedef trigger that affects ceilings or floors. The
door is passable to a player when its ceiling is at least 56
units higher than its floor. In general the door is passable to a
monster or a thing when its ceiling is at least the monster or
thing's height above the floor.<br>
<br>
If a door has a ceiling height ABOVE the fully open height, then
an open door action moves the ceiling to the fully open height
instantly.<br>
<br>
If a door has a ceiling height BELOW the fully closed height
(that is the ceiling of the door sector is lower than the floor
of the door sector) a close door action moves the ceiling to the
fully closed height instantly.</p>

<b>Section 1.2 Varieties of doors</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
A door can be triggered by pushing on it, walking over or
pressing a linedef trigger tagged to it, or shooting a linedef
tagged to it. These are called manual, walkover, switched, or gun
doors resp.<br>
<br>
Since a push door (P1/PR) has no use for its tag, BOOM has
extended the functionality to include changing any tagged sectors
to maximum neighbor lighting on fully opening, then to minimum
neighbor lighting on fully closing. This is true for regular,
extended, and generalized doors with push triggers.<br>
<br>
A door trigger can be locked. This means that the door function
will only operate if the player is in possession of the right
key(s). Regular and extended door triggers only care if the
player has a key of the right color, they do not care which.
Generalized door triggers can distinguish between skull and card
keys, and can also require any key, or all keys in order to
activate.<br>
<br>
A door can have different speeds, slow, normal, fast or turbo.<br>
<br>
A door can wait for different amounts of time.<br>
<br>
A door may or may not be activatable by monsters.<br>
<br>
Any door function except Close and Stay Closed, when closing and
encountering a monster or player's head will bounce harmlessly
off that head and return to fully open. A Close and Stay Closed
will rest on the head until it leaves the door sector.</p>

There are two generalized door linedef types, Generalized Door,
and Generalized Locked Door. The following tables show the
possibilities for each parameter, any combination of parameters
is allowed:<br>
<br>
Slow and Fast represent the same speeds as slow and fast regular
doors. Normal is twice as fast as slow, Fast is twice normal,
Turbo is twice Fast.<br>

<ul>
<li> Lowest Neighbor Floor (LnF)<br>
<br>
This means that the floor moves to the height of the lowest
neighboring floor including the floor itself. If the floor
direction is up (only possible with generalized floors) motion is
instant, else at the floor's speed.<br>
<br>
<li> Next Neighbor Floor (NnF)<br>
<br>
This means that the floor moves up to the height of the lowest
adjacent floor greater in height than the current, or down to the
height of the highest adjacent floor less in height than the
current, as determined by the floor's direction. Instant motion
is not possible in this case. If no such floor exists, the floor
does not move.<br>
<br>
<li> Lowest Neighbor Ceiling (LnC)<br>
<br>
This means that the floor height changes to the height of the
lowest ceiling possessed by any neighboring sector, including
that floor's ceiling. If the target height is in the opposite
direction to floor motion, motion is instant, otherwise at the
floor action's speed.<br>
<br>
<li> 8 Under Lowest Neighbor Ceiling (8uLnC)<br>
<br>
This means that the floor height changes to 8 less than the
height of the lowest ceiling possessed by any neighboring sector,
including that floor's ceiling. If the target height is in the
opposite direction to floor motion, motion is instant, otherwise
at the floor action's speed.<br>
<br>
<li> Highest Neighbor Floor (HnF)<br>
<br>
This means that the floor height changes to the height of the
highest neighboring floor, excluding the floor itself. If no
neighbor floor exists, the floor moves down to -32000. If the
target height is in the opposite direction to floor motion, the
motion is instant, otherwise it occurs at the floor action's
speed.<br>
<br>
<li> 8 Above Highest Neighbor Floor (8aHnF)<br>
<br>
This means that the floor height changes to 8 above the height of
the highest neighboring floor, excluding the floor itself. If no
neighbor floor exists, the floor moves down to -31992. If the
target height is in the opposite direction to floor motion, the
motion is instant, otherwise it occurs at the floor action's
speed.<br>
<br>
<li> Ceiling<br>
<br>
The floor moves up until its at ceiling height, instantly if
floor direction is down (only available with generalized types),
at the floor speed if the direction is up.<br>
<br>
<li> 24 Units (24)<br>
<br>
The floor moves 24 units in the floor action's direction. Instant
motion is not possible with this linedef type.<br>
<br>
<li> 32 Units (32)<br>
<br>
The floor moves 32 units in the floor action's direction. Instant
motion is not possible with this linedef type.<br>
<br>
<li> 512 Units (512)<br>
<br>
The floor moves 512 units in the floor action's direction.
Instant motion is not possible with this linedef type.<br>
<br>
<li> Shortest Lower Texture (SLT)<br>
<br>
The floor moves the height of the shortest lower texture on the
boundary of the sector, in the floor direction. Instant motion is
not possible with this type. In the case that there is no
surrounding texture the motion is to -32000 or +32000 depending
on direction.<br>
<br>
<li> None<br>
<br>
Some pure texture type changes are provided for changing the
floor texture and/or sector type without moving the floor.</p>

<br>
A floor can be activated by pushing on a linedef bounding it
(generalized types only), or by pushing on a switch with the same
tag as the floor sector, or by walking over a linedef with the
same tag as the floor, or by shooting a linedef with the same tag
as the floor with an impact weapon.<br>
<br>
A floor can move either Up or Down.<br>
<br>
A floor can move with speeds of Slow, Normal, Fast, or Turbo. If
the target height specified by the floor function (see Floor
Targets above) is in the opposite direction to the floor's
motion, then travel is instantaneous, otherwise its at the speed
specified.<br>
<br>
A floor action can be a texture change type, in which case after
the action the floor texture of the affected floor, and possibly
the sector type of the affected floor are changed to those of a
model sector. The sector type may be zeroed instead of copied
from the model, or not changed at all. These change types are
referred to below as Tx (texture only), Tx0 (type zeroed), and
TxTy (texture and type changed). The model sector for the change
may be the sector on the first sidedef of the trigger (trigger
model) or the sector with floor at destination height across the
lowest numbered two-sided linedef surrounding the affected sector
(numeric model). If no model sector exists, no change occurs. If
a change occurs, floor texture is always affected, lighting is
never affected, even that corresponding to the sector's type, nor
is any other sector property other than the sector's type.<br>
<br>
Numeric model algorithm:<br>
<br>
1) Find all floors adjacent to the tagged floor at destination
height<br>
2) Find the lowest numbered linedef separating those floors from
that tagged<br>
3) The sector on the other side of that linedef is the model<br>
<br>
A floor action can have the crush property, in which case players
and monsters are crushed when the floor tries to move above the
point where they fit exactly underneath the ceiling. This means
they take damage until they die, leave the sector, or the floor
action is stopped. A floor action never reverses on encountering
an obstacle, even if the crush property is not true, the floor
merely remains in the same position until the obstacle is removed
or dies, then continues.</p>

<br>
A platform is basically a floor action involving two heights. The
simple raise platform actions, for example, differ from the
corresponding floor actions in that if they encounter an
obstacle, they reverse direction and return to their former
height.<br>
<br>
The most often used kind of platform is a lift which travels from
its current height to the target height, then waits a specified
time and returns to it former height.</p>

<b>Section 4.1 Platform Targets</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Lowest Neighbor Floor<br>
<br>
This means that the platforms &quot;low&quot; height is the
height of the lowest surrounding floor, including the platform
itself. The &quot;high&quot; height is the original height of the
floor.<br>
<br>
<li> Next Lowest Neighbor Floor<br>
<br>
This means that the platforms &quot;low&quot; height is the
height of the highest surrounding floor lower than the floor
itself. If no lower floor exists, no motion occurs as the
&quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; heights are then both equal
to the floors current height.<br>
<br>
<li> Lowest Neighbor Ceiling<br>
<br>
This means that the platforms &quot;low&quot; height is the
height of the lowest surrounding ceiling unless this is higher
than the floor itself. If no adjacent ceiling exists, or is
higher than the floor no motion occurs as the &quot;low&quot; and
&quot;high&quot; heights are then both equal to the floors
current height.<br>
<br>
<li> Lowest and Highest Floor<br>
<br>
This target sets the &quot;low&quot; height to the lowest
neighboring floor, including the floor itself, and the
&quot;high&quot; height to the highest neighboring floor,
including the floor itself. When this target is used the floor
moves perpetually between the two heights. Once triggered this
type of linedef runs permanently, even if the motion is
temporarily suspended with a Stop type. No other floor action can
be commanded on the sector after this type is begun.<br>
<br>
<li> Ceiling<br>
<br>
This target sets the &quot;high&quot; height to the ceiling of
the sector and the &quot;low&quot; height to the floor height of
the sector and is only used in the instant toggle type that
switches the floor between the ceiling and its original height on

A platform can be activated by pushing on a linedef bounding it
(generalized types only), or by pushing on a switch with the same
tag as the platform sector, or by walking over a linedef with the
same tag as the platform, or by shooting a linedef with the same
tag as the platform with an impact weapon.<br>
<br>
A platform can move with speeds of Slow, Normal, Fast, or Turbo.
Only the instant toggle platform moves instantly, all others move
at the platform's speed.<br>
<br>
A platform can have a delay, in between when it reaches
&quot;high&quot; height and returns to &quot;low&quot; height, or
at both ends of the motion in the case of perpetual lifts.<br>
<br>
A platform action can be a texture change type, in which case
after the action the floor texture of the affected floor, and
possibly the sector type of the affected floor are changed to
those of a model sector. The sector type may be zeroed instead of
copied from the model, or not changed at all. These change types
are referred to below as Tx (texture only), Tx0 (type zeroed),
and TxTy (texture and type changed). The model sector for the
change is always the sector on the first sidedef of the trigger
(trigger model). If a change occurs, floor texture is always
affected, lighting is never affected, even that corresponding to
the sector's type, nor is any other sector property other than
the sector's type.</p>

<br>
A crusher ceiling is a linedef type that causes the ceiling to
cycle between its starting height and 8 above the floor, damaging
monsters and players that happen to be in between. Barrels
explode when crushed.<br>
<br>
Once a crusher ceiling is started it remains running for the
remainder of the level even if temporarily suspended with a stop
type. No other ceiling action can be used in that sector
thereafter.<br>

<a name="crushvar">

A crusher can be activated by pushing on a linedef bounding it

same tag as the crusher, or by shooting a linedef with the same
tag as the crusher with an impact weapon (generalized types
only).<br>
<br>
A crusher has a speed: slow, normal, fast, or turbo. The slower
the speed, the more damage the crusher does when crushing, simply
thru being applied longer. When a slow or normal crusher is
moving down and encounters something to crush, it slows down even
more, by a factor of 8. This persists until it reaches bottom of
stroke and starts up again. Fast and turbo crushers do not slow
down.<br>
<br>
A crusher can be silent. The regular silent crusher makes
platform stop and start noises at top and bottom of stroke. The
generalized silent crusher is completely quiet.<br>
<br>
A crusher linedef is provided to stop a crusher in its current
position. Care should be used that this doesn't lock the player
out of an area of the wad if the crusher is too low to pass. A
crusher can be restarted, but not changed, with any crusher
linedef.</p>

<b>Section 6. Stair Builders</b>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
A stair builder is a linedef type that sets a sequence of sectors
defined by a complex rule to an ascending or descending sequence
of heights.<br>
<br>
The rule for stair building is as follows:<br>
<br>
1) The first step to rise or fall is the tagged sector. It rises
or falls by the stair stepsize, at the stair speed.<br>
<br>
2) To find the next step (sector) affected examine all two-sided
linedefs with first sidedef facing into the previous step for the
one with lowest linedef number. The sector on the other side of
this linedef is the next step. If no such linedef exists, stair
building ceases.<br>
<br>
3) If the next step is already moving, or has already risen as
part of the stair, stair building ceases. Optionally if the floor
texture of the next step is different from the previous step's
the stair building stops. Otherwise the next step moves to the
height of the previous step plus or minus the stepsize depending
on the direction the stairs build, up or down. If the motion is
in the same direction as the stairs build, it occurs at stair
build speed, otherwise it is instant.<br>
<br>
4) Repeat from step 2 until stair building ceases.</p>

<p>
<a name="stairvar">
<hr width="50%" align="left">

<br>
A stair can be activated by pushing on a linedef bounding it
(generalized types only), or by pushing on a switch with the same
tag as the stair sector, or by walking over a linedef with the
same tag as the stair, or by shooting a linedef with the same tag
as the stair with an impact weapon (generalized types only).<br>
<br>
Only extended and generalized stair types are retriggerable. The
extended retriggerable stairs are mostly useless, though
triggering a stair with stepsize 8 twice might be used. The
generalized retriggerable stairs alternate building up and down
on each activation which is much more useful.<br>
<br>
A stair can build up or down (generalized types only).<br>
<br>
A stair can have a step size of 4, 8, 16, or 24. Only generalized
types support stepsize of 4 or 24.<br>
<br>
A stair can have build speeds of slow, normal, fast or turbo.
Only generalized types support speeds of normal or turbo.<br>
<br>
A stair can stop on encountering a different texture or ignore
(generalized types only) different textures and continue.<br>
<br>
Only the regular build fast, stepsize 16 stair has the property
that monsters and players can be crushed by the motion, all
others do not crush.</p>

An exit can be normal or secret. The normal exit simply ends the

the IWAD being played. In DOOM the secret exits can be on E1M3,
E2M5, or E3M6. In DOOM II they can be in levels 15 and 31. If a
secret exit is used in any other level, it brings you back to the
start of the current level. In DOOM the secret exits go from E1M3
to E1M9, E2M5 to E2M9, and E3M6 to E3M9. In DOOM II they go from
15 to 31 and from 31 to 32. In DOOM II a normal exit from 31 or

<b>Section 9. Teleporters</b>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
A teleporter is a linedef that when crossed or switched makes the
player or monster appear elsewhere in the level. There are only
regular and extended teleporters, no generalized teleporters
exist (yet). Teleporters are the only direction sensitive
walkover triggers in DOOM (to allow them to be exited without
teleporting again). They must be crossed from the first sidedef
side in order to work.<br>
<br>
The place that the player or monster appears is set in one of two
ways. The more common is by a teleport thing in the sector tagged
to the teleport line. The newer completely player preserving
line-line silent teleport makes the player appear relative to the
exit line (identified by having the same tag as the entry line)
with the same orientation, position, momentum and height that
they had relative to the entry line just before teleportation. A
special kind of line-line teleporter is also provided that
reverses the player's orientation by 180 degrees.<br>
<br>
In the case of several lines tagged the same as the teleport
line, or several sectors tagged the same, or several teleport
things in the tagged sector, in all cases the lowest numbered one
is used.<br>
<br>
In DOOM crossing a W1 teleport line in the wrong direction used
it up, and it was never activatable. In BOOM this is not the
case, it does not teleport but remains active until next crossed
in the right direction.<br>
<br>
If the exit of a teleporter is blocked a monster (or anything
besides a player) will not teleport thru it. However if the exit
of teleporter is blocked a player will, including into a down
crusher, a monster, or another player. In the latter two cases
the monster/player occupying the spot dies messily, and this is
called a telefrag.</p>

<br>
A teleporter can be walkover or switched, and retriggerable or
not.<br>
<br>
A teleporter can have destination set by a teleport thing in the
tagged sector, or by a line tagged the same as the teleport line.
These are called thing teleporters and line teleporters resp.<br>
<br>
A teleporter can preserve orientation or set orientation from the
position, height, and angle of the teleport thing. Note a thing
destination teleporter always sets position, though it may
preserve orientation otherwise.<br>
<br>
A teleporter can produce green fog and a whoosh noise, or it can
be silent, in which case it does neither.<br>

A donut is a very specialized linedef type that lowers a pillar
in a surrounding pool, while raising the pool and changing its
texture and type.<br>
<br>
The tagged sector is the pillar, and its lowest numbered line
must be two-sided. The sector on the other side of that is the
pool. The pool must have a two-sided line whose second sidedef
does not adjoin the pillar, and the sector on the second side of
the lowest numbered such linedef is the model for the pool's
texture change. The model sector floor also provides the
destination height both for lowering the pillar and raising the
pool.<br>
<br>
No generalized donut linedefs exist, and all are switched or
walkover.</p>

Boom sectors controlled by a 242 linedef are partitioned into 3
spaces. The viewer's xyz coordinates uniquely determine which
space they are in.<br>
<br>
If they are in space B (normal space), then the floor and ceiling
textures and lightlevel from the real sector are used, and the
colormap from the 242 linedef's first sidedef's normal texture is
used (COLORMAP is used if it's invalid or missing). The floor and
ceiling are rendered at the control sector's heights.<br>
<br>
If they are in space C (&quot;underwater&quot;), then the floor
and ceiling textures and lightlevel from the control sector are
used, and the lower texture in the 242 linedef's first sidedef is
used as the colormap.<br>
<br>
If they are in space A (&quot;head over ceiling&quot;), then the
floor and ceiling textures and lightlevel from the control sector
are used, and the upper texture in the 242 linedef's first
sidedef is used as the colormap.<br>
<br>
If only two of these adjacent partitions in z-space are used,
such as underwater and normal space, one has complete control
over floor textures, ceiling textures, light level, and
colormaps, in each of the two partitions. The control sector
determines the textures and lighting in the more
&quot;unusual&quot; case (e.g. underwater).<br>
<br>
It's also possible for the fake floor to extend below the real
floor, in which case an invisible platform / stair effect is
created. In that case, the picture looks like this (barring any
ceiling effects too):<br>
<br>
<pre>
     ----------------------------------  < real sector's ceiling texture
    |   real ceiling = fake ceiling    |
    |                                  |
    |                                  |
    |              B                   | < real sector's lightlevel
    |                                  | < normal texture's colormap
    |                                  |
    |          real floor              |
     ----------------------------------  < invisible, no texture drawn
    |                                  |
    |                                  |
    |                                  | < real sector's lightlevel
    |              C                   | < normal texture's colormap
    |                                  |
    |                                  |
    |          fake floor              | < real sector's floor texture
     ----------------------------------  < fake sector's floor height
</pre>

In this case, since the viewer is always at or above the fake
floor, no colormap/lighting/texture changes occur -- the fake
floor just gets drawn at the control sector's height, but at the
real sector's lighting and texture, while objects stand on the
higher height of the real floor.<br>
<br>
It's the viewer's position relative to the fake floor and/or fake
ceiling, which determines whether the control sector's lighting
and textures should be used, and which colormap should be used.
If the viewer is always between the fake floor and fake ceiling,
then no colormap, lighting, or texture changes occur, and the
view just sees the real sector's textures and light level drawn
at possibly different heights.<br>
<br>
If the viewer is below the fake floor height set by the control
sector, or is above the fake ceiling height set by the control
sector, then the corresponding colormap is used (lower or upper
texture name), and the textures and lighting are taken from the
control sector rather than the real sector. They are still
stacked vertically in standard order -- the control sector's
ceiling is always drawn above the viewer, and the control
sector's floor is always drawn below the viewer.<br>
<br>
The kaleidescope effect only occurs when F_SKY1 is used as the
control sector's floor or ceiling. If F_SKY1 is used as the
control sector's ceiling texture, then under water, only the
control sector's floor appears, but it &quot;envelops&quot; the
viewer. Similarly, if F_SKY1 is used as the control sector's
floor texture, then when the player's head is over a fake
ceiling, the control sector's ceiling is used throughout.<br>
<br>
F_SKY1 causes HOM when used as a fake ceiling between the viewer
and normal space. Since there is no other good use for it, this
kaleidescope is an option turned on by F_SKY1. Note that this
does not preclude the use of sky REAL ceilings over deep water --
this is the control sector's ceiling, the one displayed when the
viewer is underwater, not the real one.<br>
<br>
A colormap has the same size and format as Doom's COLORMAP. Extra
colormaps may defined in Boom by adding them between C_START and
C_END markers in wads. Colormaps between C_START and C_END are
automatically merged by Boom with any previously defined
colormaps.<br>
<br>
WATERMAP is a colormap predefined by Boom which can be used to
provide a blue-green tint while the player is under water.
WATERMAP can be modified by pwads.<br>
<br>
Ceiling bleeding may occur if required upper textures are not
used.<br>

223   Ext    --   Length Sets Friction in tagged Sector,Sludge&lt;100, Ice&gt;100
</pre>
</a>
The length of the linedef with type 223 controls the amount of
friction experienced by the player in the tagged sector, when in
contact with the floor. Lengths less than 100 are sticker than
normal, lengths greater than 100 are slipperier than normal. The
effect is only present in the tagged sector when its friction
enable bit (bit 8) in the sector type is set. This allows the
flat to be changed in conjunction with turning the effect on or
off thru texture/type changes.</p>

271   Ext    --   Transfer sky texture to tagged sectors 
272   Ext    --   Transfer sky texture to tagged sectors, flipped
</pre>
</a>

These linedefs transfer wall textures to skies. F_SKY1 must still
be used as the floor or ceiling texture in the sectors for which
sky is desired, but the presence of a 271 or 272
property-transfer linedef can change the sky texture to something
other than a level-based default.<br>
<br>
Every sector with F_SKY1 floor or ceiling which shares the same
sector tag as the 271 or 272 linedef will use a sky texture based
on the upper texture of the first sidedef in the 271 or 272
linedef. Sectors with F_SKY1 floors or ceilings which are not
tagged with 271 or 272 linedefs, behave just like Doom.<br>
<br>
Horizontal offsets or scrolling in the transferred texture, is
converted into rotation of the sky texture. Vertical offsets or
scrolling is transferred as well, allowing for precise
adjustments of sky position. Unpegging in the sky transfer
linedef does not affect the sky texture.<br>
<br>
Horizontal scrolling of the transferred upper wall texture is
converted into rotation of the sky texture, but it occurs at a
very slow speed relative to the moving texture, allowing for
long-period rotations (such as one complete revolution per Doom
real-time hour).<br>
<br>
Effects other than sky-transfer effects are not excluded from the
affected sector(s), and tags can be shared so long as the effects
are unambiguous. For example, a wall-scrolling linedef can share
a sector tag with both its affectee linedef (the one being
scrolled), and with the sector that the latter controls. There is
no ambiguity because one effect (scrolling) applies to a linedef,
while the other effect (sky transfer) applies to a sector.<br>
<br>
If a sector underneath a special sky needs to be set up to have a
different purpose (for example, if it is a lift or a
stairbuilder), then two tags will need to be created, and the
transfer linedef and any scrolling linedefs will need to be
duplicated as well, so that the same effect as far as the sky
goes, is duplicated in two separate sector tags. This will not
affect sky appearance, but it will allow a special sector which
needs a unique tag, to sit under such a sky.<br>
<br>
Animated textures may be transferred to skies as well.<br>
<br>
In Doom, skies were flipped horizontally. To maintain
compatibility with this practice, the 272 linedef flips the wall
image horizontally. The 271 linedef does not flip the wall image,
and it is intended to make it easier to take existing non-flipped
wall textures and transfer them to skies.<br>
<br>
Sky textures which are different must be separated by non-sky
textures, or else the results are undefined.</p>
<br>
Note for Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 6 and later: Sky textures
will be rendered using the maximum of the texture height and the height
of the tallest patch in the texture, in order to properly support tall
skies that do not require stretching for mlook. Because of this, textures
which are meant to cut off a taller patch at the texture height will not
appear as expected when used as sky textures. Avoid using sky textures
which contain patches taller than the texture to avoid this problem.

Constant pushers

Two types of constant pushers are available, wind and current.
Depending on whether you are above, on, or below (special water
sectors) the ground level, the amount of force varies.<br>

The linedef should be tagged to the sector where you want the
effect. The special type of the sector should have bit 9 set
(0x200). If this bit is turned off, the effect goes away. For
example, a fan creating a wind could be turned off, and the wind
dies, by changing the sector type and clearing that bit.<br>

Two types of point pushers are available, push and pull.<br>
<br>
The previous implementation of these was SECTOR-SPECIFIC. The new
implementation ignores sector boundaries and provides the effect
in a circular area whose center is defined by a Thing of type
5001 (push) or 5002 (pull). You now also don't have to set any
option flags on these Things. A new linedef type of 226 is used
to control the effect, and this line should be tagged to the
sector with the 5001/5002 Thing.<br>
<br>
The length of the linedef defines the 'full' magnitude of the
force, and the force is inversely proportional to distance from
the point source. If the length of the controlling linedef is L,
then the force is reduced to zero at a distance of 2L.<br>
<br>
The angle of the controlling linedef is not used.<br>
<br>
The sector where the 5001/5002 Things reside must have bit 9 set

action of a sector.<br>
<br>
The floor or ceiling movement of the sector on the first side of
one of these lines will be transferred to the y offsets of both
sidedefs of all like-tagged 3DMixTex lines. If the transfer
sector or the tagged lines are blocked by a moving object such as

The most basic kind of scrolling linedef causes some part of the
tagged sector or tagged wall to scroll, in proportion to the
length of the linedef the trigger is on, and according to the
direction that trigger linedef lies. For each 32 units of length
of the trigger, the tagged object scrolls 1 unit per frame. Since
the length of a linedef doesn't change during gameplay, these
types are static, the scrolling effect remains constant during
gameplay. However, these effects can be combined with, and/or
canceled by, other scrollers.<br>

<ul>
<li> 250 -- Scroll Tagged Ceiling<br>

floor move in the direction of the linedef trigger, 1 unit per
frame for each 32 units of linedef trigger length.<br>
<br>
<li> 254 -- Scroll Tagged Wall, Same as Floor/Ceiling<br>
<br>
Walls with the same tag as the linedef trigger scroll at the same
rate as a floor or ceiling controlled by one of 250-253, allowing
their motion to be synchronized. When the linedef trigger is not
parallel to the wall, the component of the linedef in the
direction perpendicular to the wall causes the wall to scroll
vertically. The length of the component parallel to the wall sets
the horizontal scroll rate, the length of the component
perpendicular to the wall sets the vertical scroll rate.

For convenience three simpler static scroll functions are

to control its rate and don't want to bother with
proportionality.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> 255 -- Scroll Wall Using Sidedef Offsets <br>
<br>
For simplicity, a static scroller is provided that scrolls the
first sidedef of a linedef, based on its x- and y- offsets. No
tag is used. The x offset controls the rate of horizontal
scrolling, 1 unit per frame per x offset, and the y offset
controls the rate of vertical scrolling, 1 unit per frame per y
offset.<br>

A linedef with this type scrolls its first sidedef left at a
constant rate of 1 unit per frame.<br>

<b>Section 12.3 Dynamic Scrolling</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
To achieve dynamic scrolling effects, the position or rate of
scrolling is controlled by the relative position of the floor and
ceiling of the sector on the scrolling trigger's first sidedef.
The direction of scrolling remains controlled by the direction of
the linedef trigger. Either the floor or ceiling may move in the
controlling sector, or both. The control variable is the amount
of change in the sum of the floor and ceiling heights.<br>
<br>
All scroll effects are additive, and thus two or more effects may
reinforce and/or cancel each other.<br>
<br>
Displacement Scrollers<br>
<br>
In the first kind, displacement scrolling, the position of the
scrolled objects or walls changes proportionally to the motion of
the floor or ceiling in the sector on the first sidedef of the
scrolling trigger. The proportionality is set by the length of
the linedef trigger. If it is 32 units long, the wall, floor,
ceiling, or object moves 1 unit for each unit the floor or
ceiling of the controlling sector moves. If it is 64 long, they
move 2 units per unit of relative floor/ceiling motion in the
controlling sector and so on.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> 245 -- Scroll Tagged Ceiling w.r.t. 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
The tagged sector's ceiling texture scrolls in the direction of
the scrolling trigger line, when the sector on the trigger's
first sidedef changes height. The amount moved is the height
change times the trigger length, divided by 32. Objects attached
to the ceiling do not move.<br>
<br>
<li> 246 -- Scroll Tagged Floor w.r.t. 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
The tagged sector's floor texture scrolls in the direction of the
scrolling trigger line when the sector on the trigger's first
sidedef changes height. The amount moved is the height change
times the trigger length, divided by 32. Objects on the floor do
not move.<br>
<br>
<li> 247 -- Push Objects on Tagged Floor wrt 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
Objects on the tagged sector's floor move in the direction of the
scrolling trigger line when the sector on the trigger's first
sidedef changes height. The amount moved is the height change
times the trigger length, divided by 32.<br>
<br>
<li> 248 -- Push Objects &amp; Tagged Floor wrt 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
The tagged sector's floor texture, and objects on the floor, move
in the direction of the scrolling trigger line when the sector on
the trigger's first sidedef changes height. The amount moved is
the height change times the trigger length, divided by 32. <br>
<br>
<li> 249 -- Scroll Tagged Wall w.r.t 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
Walls with the same tag as the linedef trigger scroll at the same
rate as a floor or ceiling controlled by one of 245-249, allowing
their motion to be synchronized. When the linedef trigger is not
parallel to the wall, the component of the linedef in the
direction perpendicular to the wall causes the wall to scroll
vertically. The length of the component parallel to the wall sets
the horizontal scroll displacement, the length of the component
perpendicular to the wall sets the vertical scroll displacement.
The distance scrolled is the controlling sector's height change
times the trigger length, divided by 32.<br>
</ul>
Accelerative Scrollers<br>
<br>
The second kind of dynamic scrollers, accelerative scrollers,
also react to height changes in the sector on the first sidedef
of the linedef trigger, but the RATE of scrolling changes, not
the displacement. That is, changing the controlling sector's
height speeds up or slows down the scrolling by the change in
height times the trigger's length, divided by 32. <br>
<br>
An on/off scroller can be made by using an accelerative scroller
and any linedef that changes the controlling sector's heights. If
a scroll effect which is initially on is desired, then the
accelerative scroller should be combined with a static one which
turns the scroll effect on initially. The accelerative scroller
would then need to be set up to cancel the static scroller's
effect when the controlling sector's height changes.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> 214 -- Accel Tagged Ceiling w.r.t. 1st Side's Sector<br>
<br>
The tagged sector's ceiling's rate of scroll changes in the
direction of the trigger linedef (use vector addition if already
scrolling) by the change in height of the sector on the trigger's
first sidedef times the length of the linedef trigger, divided by
32. For example, if the ceiling is motionless originally, the
linedef trigger is 32 long, and the ceiling of the controlling
sector moves 1 unit, the tagged ceiling will start scrolling at 1
unit per frame.<br>
<br>
<li> 215 -- Accel Tagged Floor w.r.t. 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
The tagged sector's floor's rate of scroll changes in the
direction of the trigger linedef (use vector addition if already
scrolling) by the change in height of the sector on the trigger's
first sidedef times the length of the linedef trigger, divided by
32. For example, if the floor is motionless originally, the
linedef trigger is 32 long, and the ceiling of the controlling
sector moves 1 unit, the tagged floor will start scrolling at 1
unit per frame.<br>
<br>
<li> 216 -- Accel Objects on Tagged Floor wrt 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
Objects on the tagged sector's floor's rate of motion changes in
the direction of the trigger linedef (use vector addition if
already moving) by the change in height of the sector on the
trigger's first sidedef times the length of the linedef trigger
divided by 32. For example, if the objects are motionless
originally, the linedef trigger is 32 long, and the ceiling of
the controlling sector moves 1 unit, the objects on the tagged
floor will start moving at 1 unit per frame.<br>
<br>
<br>
<li> 217 -- Accel Objects&amp;Tagged Floor wrt 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
The tagged sector's floor, and objects on it, change its rate of
motion in the direction of the trigger linedef (use vector
addition if already moving) by the change in height of the sector
on the trigger's first sidedef times the length of the linedef
trigger, divided by 32. For example, if the floor and objects are
motionless originally, the linedef trigger is 32 long, and the
ceiling of the controlling sector moves 1 unit, the objects and
the tagged floor will start moving at 1 unit per frame.<br>
<br>
<li> 218 -- Accel Tagged Wall w.r.t 1st Side's Sector <br>
<br>
Walls with the same tag as the linedef trigger increase their
scroll rate in sync with a floor or ceiling controlled by one of
214-217. When the linedef trigger is not parallel to the wall,
the component of the linedef in the direction perpendicular to
the wall causes the wall to increase its vertical scroll rate.
The length of the component parallel to the wall sets the change
in horizontal scroll rate, the length of the component
perpendicular to the wall sets the change in vertical scroll
rate. The rate change is the height change times the trigger
length, divided by 32.

Portals turn a set of floors, ceilings, or linedefs into "windows" onto another part of the

however -- objects cannot travel through them, enemies cannot see through them or fire into 
them, etc.

<b>Skyboxes</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
A skybox is a portal which renders part of the map from the point of view of a control object.
To setup a skybox, an EESkyboxCam object (doomednum 5006) must be placed in a sector. Then, one
of the following skybox portal lines must be placed in that same sector such that it is the
sector on the front side of the line. When viewed in the map, the surroundings of the control
object will be seen at their real, fixed distance from that point, although the player's
viewing angle will still be applied (so the scenery will turn, but not move).

<b>Anchored Portals</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
Anchored portals are the most complicated portal type. They define a portal similar to a skybox, 
but which moves relative to the player's point of view. This allows an anchored portal to appear 
as if it is a seamless part of the surrounding map.
<br><br>
To create an anchored portal, first one of the below anchored portal control linedefs should be
placed into the sector which will appear inside the portal. Then, the sector in which the portal
will appear should be tagged the same as the control linedef. This is the same as for all other
types.  However, an anchor line is also required so that the renderer can guage the offset
between the real map area and the portal sector. This line, with specials 298 or 299, must be 
placed in the real sector, and must share the same tag as the sector and control linedef.
<br><br>
Here is an illustration of an anchored portal setup:
<pre>
+---+              +---+
| A |-298 linedef  | B |-295 linedef
+---+              +---+
</pre>
Sector A is the normal sector in which the player will walk.  Sector B is the portal sector 
which will be drawn into the portal. The 298 linedef, the 295 linedef, and sector A all share a 
common tag. Eternity will guage the distance between the portal linedef and the anchor linedef 
and will know how far to offset the camera in order to render the portal. In this case, Eternity 
will render sector B over the ceiling of sector A, and the two will appear to be placed directly 
on top of each other.
<br><br>
As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 7, the 296 anchored portal type uses line special 299
for its anchor line. This was revised to allow separate anchored portals to be used for the
floor and ceiling of the same sector, which would not previously work. 295 and 297 still use
the 298 anchor type.
<br><br>
Note that the anchored portal will not change view height. So if sector B is below sector A 
height-wise, it will either cause strange visual artifacts, or sector B may not even render.
<br><br>
Anchored portal linedefs are as follows:
<pre>
295  Ext     --   Applies anchored portal to ceilings of all like-tagged sectors.
               
296  Ext     --   Applies anchored portal to floors of all like-tagged sectors.
                  
297  Ext     --   Applies anchored portal to floors and ceilings of all like-tagged sectors.

298  Ext     --   Anchor line, required for use alongside specials 295 and 297.

299  Ext     --   Anchor line, required for use alongside special 296.
</pre>

<p>
<a name="line289">
<hr width="50%" align="left">
<b>289: Portal Transfer</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
The portal transfer linedef allows the effects of any type of portal to be transferred to the
front side of a one-sided line (it will *not* work on 2S lines). To accomplish this, simply 
give the 289 line the same tag used by the portal control linedef which is being targetted. 
Any number of 289 lines may share a portal, and the portal may still be used normally. If the 
normal effect of the portal (applied to a floor or ceiling) is not needed, it does not have to 
be tagged to a sector.
<br><br>
An example:
<pre>
+------+---+                 +------+
|       \ B|<- B tag = 1     |      |
|        \ |                 |  C   |
|   A      +                 |      |
|          |                 |  *   |<- Skybox line special 290 , tag = 1
+----------+                 +------+
  ^                             ^
  Line special 289, tag = 1     Control thing 5006
</pre>
In this example, sector C will be visible in sector B's ceiling as a skybox. However, it will
also appear on the line in sector A with special 289, giving it a window-like effect.
<pre>
289  Ext     --   Transfers a like-tagged portal to the first side of this linedef.

<b>Section 15. Detailed Generalized Linedef Specification</b>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
BOOM has added generalized linedef types that permit the
parameters of linedef actions to be nearly independently chosen. <br>
<br>
To support these, DETH has been modified to support them via
dialogs for each generalized type; each dialog allows the
parameters for that type to be independently specified by choice
from a array of radio buttons. A parser has also been added to
support reading back the function of a generalized linedef from
its type number.<br>
<br>
NOTE to wad authors:<br>
<br>
This requires a lot of type numbers, 20608 in all so far. Some
editors may object to the presence of these new types thru
assuming that a lookup table of size 256 suffices (or some other
reason). For those that must continue to use such an editor, it
may be necessary to stick to the old linedef types, which are
still present.<br>
<br>
We are also providing command line tools to set these linedef
types, independent of which editor you happen to use, but they
are a lot less slick, and more difficult to use than DETH. See
TRIGCALC.EXE and CLED.EXE in the EDITUTIL.ZIP package of the BOOM
distribution.<br>

The following sections define the placement and meaning of the
bit fields within each linedef category. Fields in the
description are listed in increasing numeric order.<br>
<br>
Some nomenclature:<br>
<br>
Target height designations:<br>
<br>
H means highest, L means lowest, N means next, F means floor, C
means ceiling, n means neighbor, Cr means crush, sT means
shortest lower texture. <br>

Texture change designations:<br>
<br>
<pre>
c0n change texture, change sector type to 0, numeric model change
c0t change texture, change sector type to 0, trigger model change
cTn change texture only, numeric model change
cTt change texture only, trigger model change
cSn change texture and sector type to model's, numeric model change
cSt change texture and sector type to model's, trigger model change
</pre>
A trigger model change uses the sector on the first side of the
trigger for its model. A numeric model change looks at the
sectors adjoining the tagged sector at the target height, and
chooses the one across the lowest numbered two sided line for its
model. If no model exists, no change occurs. Note that in DOOM II
v1.9, no model meant an illegal sector type was generated.

3) down/up specifies the "normal" direction for moving. If the
   target specifies motion in the opposite direction, motion is instant.
   Otherwise it occurs at speed specified by speed field.
4) Speed is 1/2/4/8 units per tic
5) If change is nonzero then model determines which sector is copied.
   If model is 0 its the sector on the first side of the trigger.
   if model is 1 (numeric) then the model sector is the sector at
   destination height on the opposite side of the lowest numbered
   two sided linedef around the tagged sector. If it doesn't exist
   no change occurs.

<h3>Part II Sector Types</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
BOOM is backward compatible with DOOM's sector types. All types
0-17 have the same meaning they did under DOOM. Types 18-31 are
reserved for extended sector types, that work like DOOM's and
share the limitation that only one type can be active in a sector
at once. No extended sector types are implemented at this time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="sectors">
<hr width="75%" align="left">
<b>Section 16. Regular Sector types</b>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
From Matt Fell's Unofficial DOOM Spec the DOOM sector types are:<br>
<br>
<pre>
Dec Hex Class   Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 0  00  -       Normal, no special characteristic.
 1  01  Light   random off
 2  02  Light   blink 0.5 second
 3  03  Light   blink 1.0 second
 4  04  Both    -10/20% health AND light blink 0.5 second
 5  05  Damage  -5/10% health
 7  07  Damage  -2/5% health
 8  08  Light   oscillates
 9  09  Secret  a player must stand in this sector to get credit for
                  finding this secret. This is for the SECRETS ratio
                  on inter-level screens.
10  0a  Door    30 seconds after level start, ceiling closes like a door.
11  0b  End     -10/20% health. If a player's health is lowered to less
                  than 11% while standing here, then the level ends! Play
                  proceeds to the next level. If it is a final level
                  (levels 8 in DOOM 1, level 30 in DOOM 2), the game ends!
12  0c  Light   blink 0.5 second, synchronized
13  0d  Light   blink 1.0 second, synchronized
14  0e  Door    300 seconds after level start, ceiling opens like a door.
16  10  Damage  -10/20% health

17  11  Light   flickers on and off randomly
</pre>

Note that BOOM will NEVER exit the game on an illegal sector
type, as was the case with DOOM. The sector type will merely be
ignored.<br>

<b>Section 17. Generalized sector types</b>
<hr width="75%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
BOOM also provides generalized sector types, based on bit fields,
that allow several sector type properties to be independently
specified for a sector. Texture change linedefs can be used to
switch some or all of these properties dynamically, outside
lighting.<br>
<br>
Bits 0 thru 4 specify the lighting type in the sector, the same
codes that DOOM used are employed:<br>
<br>
<pre>

=== New to SMMU ===<br>
<br>
Bits 10 and 11 are now implemented as of SMMU v3.21.<br>
Bit 10 suppresses all sounds within the sector, while Bit 11
disables any sounds due to floor or ceiling motion by the sector.
Bit 11 is especially useful in silencing constructs such as
pseudo-3D bridges, which give off an undesirable plat sound when
they move.<br>
<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
0    0         Sounds made in sector function normally
1024 1         Sounds made in sector are suppressed

<h3>Part III Linedef Flags</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
Only one new linedef flag is implemented in BOOM, called PassThru,
which allows a push or switch linedef trigger to pass the push action thru it 
to ones within range behind it. In this way BOOM is capable ofsetting off many 
actions with a single push. Note that the limitation of one floor action, one 
ceiling action, and one lighting action per sector affect still applies however.
<br>
The new linedef flag is bit 9, value 512, in the linedef flags
word.<br>
<br>
<pre>
Dec Bit 9      Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------
0    0         Line absorbs all push actions as normal
512  1         Line passes push actions through to lines behind it
</pre>
=== New to Eternity v3.31 ===<br>
<br>
Eternity, starting with v3.31, implements a new line flag called 3DMidTex, 
which causes 2S linedefs using it to clip objects using the height of their
middle texture. Within the range of the texture's height, the lines are 
effectively solid and block players, monsters, and projectiles. Below or 
above, objects can pass freely. This enables very easy pseudo-3D effects.
<br>
The new linedef flag is bit 10, value 1024, in the linedef flags
word.<br>
<br>
<pre>
Dec Bit 10     Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------
0    0         Linedef is normal with respect to clipping

<h3>Part IV Thing Flags</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
BOOM has implemented two new thing flags, &quot;not in DM&quot;
and &quot;not in COOP&quot;, which in combination with the
existing &quot;not in Single&quot; flag, usually called
&quot;Multiplayer&quot;, allow complete control over a level's
inventory and monsters, in any game mode.<br>
<br>
If you want a thing to be only available in Single play, you set
both the &quot;not in DM&quot; and &quot;not in COOP&quot; flags.
Other combinations are similar.<br>
<br>
&quot;not in DM&quot; is bit 5, value 32, in the thing flags
word.<br>
&quot;not in COOP&quot; is bit 6, value 64, in the thing flags
word.<br>
<br>
=== New to MBF ===<br>
<br>
MBF introduces one new mapthing flag<br>
<br>
&quot;friendly&quot; is bit 7, value 128, in the thing flags
word.<br>
<br>
This flag may be placed on any object, but will only have an
effect on sentient enemies. When given this flag, a thing will
use MBF's friendly entity logic, and will help the player to
defeat enemies in the level.<br>
<br>
To use this flag, you must manually add the value 128 to the
thing's flags using either DETH's &quot;enter value&quot; menu,
or a tool such as CLED which can manipulate any level data field.<br>
<br>
Bit 8, value 256, has been reserved for detecting editors which
set flags they do not understand. It should not be set or else
all extended flags will be cleared.<br>
<br>
=== New to Eternity ===<br>
<br>
Eternity introduces one new mapthing flag<br>
<br>
&quot;dormant&quot; is bit 9, value 512, in the thing flags word.<br>
<br>
Things given this flag are invincible and will remain in their
spawn state until a script calls the objawaken function on them,
from which point onward they act normally.<br>

<h3>Part V Thing Types</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
BOOM has implemented two new thing types as well, <b>BoomPushPoint</b> (5001),
and <b>BoomPullPoint</b> (5002). These control the origin of the point source
wind effect controlled by linedef types 225 and 226, and set
whether the wind blows towards or away from the origin depending
on which is used.<br>
<br>
=== New to MBF ===<br>
<br>
MBF introduces the following new mapthing types:<br>
<br>
<b>MBFHelperDog</b> (DoomEd #888, DeHackEd #140)<br>
A dog similar to the one found in Wolfenstein. This dog is the
one normally spawned with the player when the -dogs command-line
option is used. It is not friendly by default, but must be given
the &quot;friendly&quot; thing flag if you wish to make it so.
Otherwise it will act as a normal enemy.<br>
<br>
=== New to SMMU ===<br>
<br>
SMMU introduces the following new mapthing types:<br>
<br>
<b>SMMUCameraSpot</b> (5003)<br>
A general-purpose camera place-holder. These cameras will be
randomly chosen during &quot;cool demo playback&quot; and for a
view of the level during the intermission.<br>
<br>
=== New to Eternity ===<br>
<br>
Eternity introduces the following new mapthing types. Note that
this list does not currently contain any Heretic mapthings, which
may be documented here or elsewhere in the future. Note that
there are also some mapthing types within the engine which are
not currently documented. Maps should refrain from using those
things until they are made official, as they could change or be
deleted later.<br>
<br>
<b>Unknown</b> (5005)<br>
This thing type is used as a placeholder by EDF, ExtraData, and
scripting. It may be spawned when an unknown thing type is requested,
and its definition is required by the EDF language, so it is guaranteed
to always exist. It uses DoomEd #5005 so that it can be used by
ExtraData, but it will not generally be useful in maps.
<br><br>
<b>EESkyboxCam</b> (5006)<br>
This thing type determines the origin for rendering of a skybox portal.
See the <a href="#skybxportal">Skybox Portal</a> documentation for complete
information.
<br><br>
<b>EEParticleFountain</b> (9027 - 9033)<br>
A particle fountain will be spawned at the mapthing's location.
The fountain color depends on the mapthing number used, as
follows:<br>
<ul>
<li> 9027: Red<br>
<li> 9028: Green<br>
<li> 9029: Blue<br>
<li> 9030: Yellow<br>
<li> 9031: Purple<br>

Switches and Animations
-----------------------
SWITCHES       Definition of switch textures recognized
ANIMATED       Definition of animated textures and flats recognized
</pre>

<a name="switchformat">SWITCHES format:</a><br>
<br>
The SWITCHES lump makes the names of the switch textures used in
the game known to the engine. It consists of a list of records
each 20 bytes long, terminated by an entry (not used) whose last
2 bytes are 0.<br>
<br>
<pre>
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming "off" state texture for switch
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming "off" state texture for switch
2 bytes        Short integer for the IWADs switch will work in
                1=shareware
    2=registered/retail DOOM or shareware
    3=DOOM II, registered/retail DOOM, or shareware
    0=terminates list of known switches
</pre>

<a name="animformat">ANIMATED format:</a><br>
<br>
The ANIMATED lump makes the names of the animated flats and
textures known to the engine. It consists of a list of records,
each 23 bytes long, terminated by a record (not used) whose first
byte is -1 (255).<br>
<br>
<pre>
1 byte         -1 to terminate list, 0 if a flat, 1 if a texture
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming last texture/flat in animation
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming first texture/flat in animation
4 bytes        Animation speed, number of frames between animation changes
</pre>

The utility package contains a program, SWANTBLS.EXE that will
generate both the SWITCHES and ANIMATED lumps from a text file.
An example is provided, DEFSWANI.DAT that generates the standard
set of switches and animations for DOOM.<br>
<br>
=== New to SMMU ===<br>
<br>
Setting the animation speed for a flat to a number higher than
65535 will<br>
cause the flat to use the swirling liquid effect rather than
animation.<br>
<br>
<pre>
<a name="colmaps">Colormaps</a>
---------
WATERMAP       Custom greenish colormap for underwater use
LAVAMAP        Custom red colormap for lava (new to SMMU)
</pre>

The WATERMAP lump has the same format as COLORMAP, 34 tables of
256 bytes each, see the UDS for details. Note that colormaps you
add to a PWAD must be between C_START and C_END markers.<br>
<br>
The utility package contains a program, CMAPTOOL.EXE, that will
generate custom colormaps for use with BOOM. It also includes 7
premade colormaps, and an add-on wad containing them.<br>
<br>
<pre>
<a name="colrngs">Color translation tables</a>
------------------------
CRBRICK        Translates red range to brick red
CRTAN          Translates red range to tan
CRGRAY         Translates red range to gray
CRGREEN        Translates red range to green
CRBROWN        Translates red range to brown
CRGOLD         Translates red range to dark yellow
CRRED          Translates red range to red range (no change)
CRBLUE         Translates red range to light blue
CRBLUE2        Translates red range to dark blue (status bar numerals)
CRORANGE       Translates red range to orange
CRYELLOW       Translates red range to light yellow
</pre>

These tables are used to translate the red font characters to
other colors. They are made replaceable in order to support
custom palettes in TC's better. Note however that the font
character graphics must be defined using the palette indices for
the standard red range of the palette 176-191.<br>
<br>
=== Eternity Note ===<br>
<br>
The default text translation range in Heretic is gray rather than
red, and replacement fonts should use the gray range in the
palette to support color translations.<br>
<br>

Data Lumps and Scripts
----------------------
TXTRCONV       DOOM -> DOOM II texture conversion table (new to SMMU)
KEYDEFS        Default keybindings (new to Eternity)
TERTYPES       TerrainType definitions (new to Eternity)
</pre>

<a name="txtrconv">TXTRCONV format:</a><br>
<br>
The TXTRCONV lump is used to translate DOOM textures to DOOM II textures, for
the purpose of playing ExMy levels under DOOM II (accessed via the map command).
The format of this lump is currently very strict. The pairs of texture names must
be aligned precisely, with the first texture name (<= 8 character) starting in
column 0, followed by spaces up to column 16, where the second DOOM II replacement
texture name must start. Only one pair must be on a line, and lines must be
terminated with a line break. This lump is ASCII text.
<br><br>

<a name="keydefs">KEYDEFS format:</a><br>
<br>
KEYDEFS contains the engine's default key bindings. This lump is written to file
as keys.csc when a file by that name cannot be found. Editing of this defaults
lump is not generally desirable, but it is a simple console script, the syntax
of which is expounded upon in the <a href="console_full.txt">Eternity Engine
Console Reference</a>. This lump is ASCII text.
<br><br>

<a name="tertypes">TERTYPES format:</a><br>
<br>
The TERTYPES lump holds TerrainType definitions. It can be generated from a text
script using the TerrainEd utility. It associates flat names with the desired
TerrainType effect. The number of TerrainType records is limited to 32768.
<br>
<pre>
Header
------
2 bytes        short int, number of TerrainType records in lump

TerrainType Record
------------------
9 bytes        null-extended ASCII string, name of flat graphic lump
2 bytes        short int, index of TerrainType effect as follows:
               0 = FLOOR_SOLID,  placeholder with no effect
               1 = FLOOR_WATER,  water TerrainType
               2 = FLOOR_LAVA,   lava TerrainType
               3 = FLOOR_SLUDGE, sludge/swamp water TerrainType
               
               Higher values are reserved for additional types.
