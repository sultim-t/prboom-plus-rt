Changes since Eternity Engine v3.33.01
=====================================================================
=====================================================================
09/30/05

Fixed an unapparent bug in the customized libConfuse lexer that would
have prevented ifdef/endif style functions from working properly in
one certain case. This bug never occurred because up until now there
was no valid way to cause it, but it could have become a problem now
that ifenabled, etc. can accept multiple parameters.

=====================================================================
09/11/05

Finished up some final adjustments before 3.33.02 launch preparations
will begin. I cut the number of function calls made during column
flushing significantly by effectively inlining the calls that were
being made into new functions. 

The first case improved was when the column buffer needs to be
flushed before it's full, or when some column inside it is totally
outside the vertical range of all 3 other columns. This case now
calls the function pointer R_DrawWholeColumns, which draws up to four
complete columns out of the buffer.

The second case improved was the head/tail drawing done before a quad
flush. Eight function calls were made here to R_DrawSingleColumn
before. Now one call is made to R_DrawHTColumns, which draws the
heads and tails of all four columns in the buffer if necessary (only
parts outside the area of the quad flush must be handled).

This is the single most critical path of execution in the game engine
so I am continuing to find ways to improve it. I have concern about
word writes being done out of alignment, but I do not know if the
penalty is worse than doing 4 byte writes or not. SoM is skeptical.
Only Lee Killough would know this kind of thing unfortunately :(

It should be possible to inline the DrawHTColumns functions into the
quad flush functions themselves and reduce that case to 1 call. I'm
putting this off for the time being, however -- mainly in the
interest of expediting an already very delayed release.

=====================================================================
09/07/05

Did some more zone heap analysis and noticed that the BEX music names
table was wasting 3x the needed amount of memory by allocating all
the music names separately (like the previous issue with sprites).
Fixed to allocate space for all the music names through one pointer.

Also found the TXTRCONV lump (which allows playing DOOM maps under
DOOM II and was added in SMMU) was similarly wasting a ton of memory
first by using a static array of 256 texture entries when there are
only 54 in the file, and then by using strdup to separately allocate
the two texture names in every single structure. Now, the structures
contain two char[9] arrays and are all kept in a dynamically realloc-
ating array (ala boss brain spots).

With these changes, the heap is starting to look a lot cleaner. In
case one might wonder why lots of small allocations waste RAM in
DOOM, the zone allocator (since BOOM at least) uses a minimum block
size of 32 bytes (plus the size of the block header). This means that
for each 9-byte string allocated, you waste a minimum of 23 bytes.
Repeated for many structures, this turns out to be kilobytes, and 
Eternity is already threatening to expend the default 16 MB heap on
some larger levels, so this IS important. Huge RAM is no excuse to
be inefficient ;)  These improvements also make those respective
parts of the engine faster, since memory allocation is relatively
expensive -- the fewer calls to it, the better.

Halved the default number of particles allocated when I found out
they were using 250 KB of RAM. 4000 seems like a lot of particles. If
effects start cutting out severely, I'll either up the default or
create an easier way for projects to override it (currently only a
stupid command line option exists). Seriously, only areas on the
scale of those in nuts.wad or Mock 2 could hope to have 4000 active
particles, and allowing for the worst case all the time is silly.

=====================================================================
09/06/05

Changed the EDF ifenabled function to work on N parameters, so that
you can simultaneously test the enabled state of multiple enable
values. However, it uses AND logic, meaning all provided enables must
be on. To fill in the gap, I also provided an ifenabledany function
which uses OR logic, meaning that the block inside is evaluated if
even one of the provided enables is on.

I also added the following new functions:

ifdisabled -- Tests N enable values. If all are disabled, the block
   is evaluated.

ifdisabledany -- Tests N enable values. If any is disabled, the block
   is evaluated.
   
ifgametype -- Tests the current real game type against N game type
   parameters, rather than simply whether or not definitions 
   belonging to a certain gamemode are enabled. This was needed to 
   allow Heretic and DOOM terrain types to be enabled only in the 
   proper game type (HERETIC or DOOM respectively). While both sets
   of definitions could exist all the time, it would waste memory and
   processing time.
   
ifngametype -- Tests the current real game type against N parameters,
   and evaluates the block if it matches none of them.

=====================================================================
09/04/05

New TerrainTypes system 100% complete!

Corrected fall-to-ground particles to use deep water floors when they
are higher than the normal floor of a sector. This will stop such
particles at the surface of liquids, which is more realistic and will
cause less trouble with drips that cause terrain hits.

=====================================================================
08/23/05

Bulk of new TerrainTypes system completed. TerrainTypes, like EDF
strings, can be defined both within EDF, and within their own chain
of lumps named ETERRAIN. Use of include_prev allows for optional
cascading.

The TerrainTypes-related sections are documented here:

Splash Objects:

splash <mnemonic>
{
   smallclass = <thing type>
   smallclip  = <int>
   smallsound = <sound>
   baseclass  = <thing type>
   chunkclass = <thing type>
   sound      = <sound>
   
   chunkxvelshift = <int>
   chunkyvelshift = <int>
   chunkzvelshift = <int>
   chunkbasezvel  = <int>
}

All thing types in the splash are optional. If invalid, those things
simply won't be spawned. The cutoff for objects that make small 
splashes is, as in Hexen/zdoom, a mass of 10.

All the velocity shift values default to -1, which means not to apply
a randomized factor to the velocity. For X and Y, this means that 
there will be NO x or y velocity. For z, the base velocity is always
applied, but may also be set to zero to result in no z velocity.

Terrain Objects:

terrain <mnemonic>
{
   splash         = <splash>
   damageamount   = <int>
   damagetype     = <mod>
   damagetimemask = <int>
   footclip       = <int>
   liquid         = <boolean>
   splashalert    = <boolean>
   useptclcolors  = <boolean>
   ptclcolor1     = <palette index OR RGB triplet>
   ptclcolor2     = <palette index OR RGB triplet>
}

terraindelta
{
   name = <terrain>
   <terrain fields>
}

The splash is optional. If left to default or set to a non-existant
splash, this terrain definition will have no splashing behavior.

To have areas inflict damage based on terrain, their flat's terrain
must have a damageamount greater than zero. damagetype indicates 
what type of "Means of Damage" the damage is inflicted with, which
currently only affects obituaries (but in the future may cause
special death animations for various elemental attacks too). The
time mask determines how often the damage is done.

Footclipping is now customizable for each TerrainType. The normally
defined types all use the previous hard-coded value of 10, but this
can be set to anything zero or greater.

The liquid and splashalert flags determine different behaviors of
terrain. If a terrain is liquid, the normal player floor hit sounds
won't be played. Generally, terrains which have a splash will want
to mark themselves as liquid, but this isn't a hard rule. Some
Heretic objects (which have not yet been implemented in Eternity)
and some Hexen objects also react differently when they hit liquid
terrain, so this will become more important in the future.

Terrains with splashalert set will wake up monsters when the player 
falls into them, like in Heretic and Hexen. Unlike zdoom, this is
optional, because in DOOM it would seriously change the playability
of some maps in an unacceptable manner.

useptclcolors and the two color fields determine what special colors
are used for particle gunshots that hit the floor or ceiling. These
were previously hard-coded. You can provide an RGB triplet to these
fields which will automagically be resolved to the closest color in 
the game's palette (though you will not be pleased with the results
if there is no color close enough). For this reason, it is also
possible to specify a raw palette index from 0 to 255. This cannot
be used across more than one game, of course.

Terrain deltas are also supported, so that terrains can be edited in
the same way as things, frames, and sounds.

Floor Objects:

floor
{
   flat = <flat>
   terrain = <terrain>
}

Floor objects tie a flat to a terrain object. These are, in effect
the same as the old TerrainTypes as defined in the binary TERTYPES
lump. In fact, Eternity still supports the old lump from within the
new system, and will automatically convert the old TERTYPES lump into
floor definitions, assuming that terrains named "Water", "Lava",
and "Sludge" exist (if they don't, the floors in question are just
set to the default Solid terrain).

The flat need not even exist. If it doesn't, the floor definition
will simply never get used by the game engine. The terrain, on the
other hand, should be valid. If it isn't, the terrain will be reset
to the default Solid type.

=====================================================================
08/21/05

Work on the new TerrainTypes system continues. Added string values
for MOD types, which have been needed since the original version of
EDF.

=====================================================================
08/10/05

Completed massive EDF restructuring/rewrite effort. EDF's code is now 
divided into the following modules:

e_lib.c -- Contains utilities common to ALL "Extended Feature"
modules, which also includes ExtraData. These are functions which are
useful for any libConfuse-based system and have eliminated several
cross-system redundancies.

e_edf.c -- Still contains all the core EDF functionality, as well as
all miscellaneous stuff such as sprites, cast, boss types, and misc
variables.

e_states.c -- All frame processing is now in this new module.

e_things.c -- All thing processing is now in this new module.

e_sound.c -- This module previously existed, but now contains ALL
sound processing code.

e_string.c -- This module previously existed, but now contains ALL
string processing code.

e_edf.c itself was reduced from a +4000-line disaster to only around
1500 lines of code. Entanglement was reduced, and all the individual
modules are now much easier to manage.

To facilitate this division, I also revamped the EDF verbose logging
and error reporting facilities, and took the opportunity to fix
several error messages that didn't give enough info, or didn't give
the PROPER info (ie thing/frame internal number instead of a much
more useful name). I also authored an EDF which, with individual
lines uncommented, can trigger almost any error. This is really
useful for bug testing and doc correctness checking.

In the process, bugs were found. Default EDF fallback behavior was
broken due to the presence of ifenabled() function calls in the EDF
files. I forgot to enable these functions within the option arrays
used when modules are processed individually for fallbacks.

=====================================================================
08/05/05

Added a generalized double-linked list with ** prev pointers, similar
to the generalized queue code. This is Lee Killough's clever system
that, while only allowing unidirectional traversal, treats all nodes
the same and is extremely efficient at linking and unlinking.
Particles now use this, as well as the chains of the EDF strings
numeric id hash table, which must now allow string objects to be
removed from the hash and then reinserted with new numeric ids (since
entries amongst various ESTRINGS lumps may specify different numeric
ids for like-named string sections).

=====================================================================
07/27/05

Finally got around to adding back the "Are you sure?" message to the
skill select menu when the player chooses the Nightmare! skill. This
was yet another fundamental DOOM feature that got lost in SMMU's
menu rewrite. I didn't even know it was missing until a few months
ago (I personally use the startmap, for what it's worth).

=====================================================================
07/25/05

Standardized the EE TerrainTypes objects for water, lava, and muck
terrain. Eliminated several do-nothing Eternity TC codepointers and
objects that used them, including the "broken axe" and "broken staff"
that were thrown out by the Cyberdemon Guard when he woke up.

Began implementation of the new EDF-related TerrainTypes system.
This is going to take quite a while to finish, but it is coming along
very nicely. If not for libConfuse syntactical restrictions, it would
almost be source-compatible with zdoom -- despite using none of its
code whatsoever :)

=====================================================================
07/24/05

Added EDF infrastructure to support separate lumps which can be
parsed apart from the root EDF hierarchy, and any definitions which
can be accepted in such lumps are additive over those found in EDF.
Cascading is optional, and must be explicitly enabled via use of the
new "include_prev()" function. This EDF function, only callable from
wad lumps, includes the previous lump of the same name as the one
being parsed. This means that if you load two wads back to back that
both define ESTRINGS lumps, the parsing starts from the ESTRINGS
lump in the second wad loaded. If that ESTRINGS lump calls the
include_prev function, the first ESTRINGS lump will also be parsed.

Making this optional is better than making it required, since not all
modifications are going to be compatible, but some may be designed to
work over other existing modifications.

=====================================================================
07/23/05

Found out what was causing the crusher demo desyncs that were report-
ed on Doomworld's Demos forum. When adding the ability to have custom
crushing damage via parameterized linedef specials, I missed a SINGLE
line of code:

if(crush == true)

This line of code needed to be changed to the following:

if(crush > 0)

This is because "crush", which was once just a boolean telling the
game whether or not it should be crushing stuff, is now an integer
that, if greater than zero, means to crush stuff AND tells how much
damage to deal while doing it.

I overlooked this tiny line of code at least two dozen times while
searching for the cause of this problem, which naturally drove me
half-insane and had me barking up all the wrong trees, including at
various points 3D object clipping and 3DMidTex clipping. Chalk up
another retarded error.

=====================================================================
07/13/05

Began adding particle drip object, requested by the Millennium
project. This object will require ExtraData so that it can be spawned
with the proper mapthing argument values to determine color, size,
frequency, and other properties. However, full implementation has
been suspended pending completion of the new EDF-based TerrainTypes
specification.

Modified the FLIES particle effect and added a new sister effect
called FLIESONDEATH, which works virtually identical to the Quake 2
fly particle effect. The effect now comes with its own sound effect,
and to support proper sound behavior with this effect, I had to add
a new EDF sound feature to the game engine: each sound definition can
now specify customized attenuation behavior using two separate
parameters:

1) The distance at which the sound is fully clipped away
2) The distance at which the sound should be at full volume

Attenuation is currently always linear between these two distances.

This allows sound in DOOM to have a much finer volume resolution than 
what was previously available, and liberal use of this feature should
make ambient sounds in mod projects much less irritating. I am 
totally unaware of why this wasn't done in some other source port,
like BOOM. It's a really great, easy, and logical feature to add ;)

Restructured the code in P_MobjThinker that handles nightmare respawn
because it was a nasty mess, and because the new FLIESONDEATH effect
requires objects with that particle effects flag to have their
movecount updated while they are dead, just as it is for nightmare
respawning monsters. This requires the movecount increment to be
done a bit earlier, before any returns are taken from that code
segment -- otherwise, some objects wouldn't work with FLIESONDEATH.
This could possibly impact some demos from older Eternity versions,
but those are pretty much screwed to hell already with the changes
to TerrainTypes and y-shearing, so I've stopped caring. AFAIK, no
such demos exist anyway ;)

=====================================================================
07/08/05

Eternity removed collectable objects before checking them for the
COUNTITEM flag. I changed this behavior as it seems a bit hazardous,
even with deferred object removal. I prefer to treat removed objects
as though they have been freed as much as possible.

=====================================================================
07/06/05

At long last, added a fix for DOOM thing heights when running in 3D
object clipping mode. comp_theights toggles this on and off for full
backward compatibility. Also, to maintain playability, a new flags3
flag value has been defined and has been given to all affected DOOM
and DOOM II decoration objects that allows missile checks and ONLY
missile checks to use the OLD, original height values of the objects.

The entire reason decor objects had incorrect height information in
DOOM and DOOM II was to allow projectiles to go through them.
Changing this, even under a comp flag, unreasonably alters the
playability of many maps, so I consider it unacceptable. Making the
behavior flag-controlled also allows it to be applied to user-made
objects, which may prove useful in the future.

=====================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v3.33.00
=====================================================================
=====================================================================
06/21/05

Began earnest research into what is necessary to give Eternity 
working netcode. The changes required or at the least prompted by
this would touch several thousand lines of code. I have added more 
than seventy new FIXME's in the catagories of NETCODE, CONSOLE, DEMO,
WEAPON, CONFIG, and COMPAT that are all interrelated to some degree.
If this project is undertaken, it will end up removing most of the 
SMMU code that is currently left in Eternity and will nearly render
it a new engine. It may require extensive borrowing of ideas and 
possibly code from Quake 2 and, to a lesser degree, zdoom.

=====================================================================
06/15/05

Added two new codepointers, RandomWalk and TargetJump, which are
needed by CQIII for non-player characters.

=====================================================================
06/08/05

Noticed that patch widgets must account for a patch's offsets when
erasing the area the patch covers.

Added rangechecking to R_VideoErase in case user patch or text
widgets extend off the screen. Attempting to erase off the screen
would otherwise cause a very hard crash.

=====================================================================
06/07/05

Made crosshair highlighting optional by user request.

Added a new thing flag, NOFRIENDDMG, by user request. Things with
the flag won't take damage from any thing that has the FRIEND flag.

=====================================================================
06/06/05

Discovered a long-standing problem in the teleportation code while
using the whistle command on ChexBuddy. He would always get stuck 
inside of inert objects, but not inside enemies. I discovered that
for some reason, DOOM totally ignores objects without the SHOOTABLE
flag when determining whether or not something can teleport to a 
spot. The comment there indicates that since the thing isn't 
shootable, it can't be telefragged either. However, the proper thing
to do would be to deny the teleportation instead of sticking the
player or other thing into the inert object. To fix this for specific
applications of teleporting, I added a static global var and a new
function called P_TeleportMoveStrict which sets it. When that var is
set, PIT_StompThing will do a full clipping check when it encounters 
an unshootable object instead of ignoring it by returning true as if
it doesn't exist. The whistle command now uses the strict function. 
Other teleports will still get you stuck inside inert objects, for 
full compatibility.

=====================================================================
06/04/05

Complete rewrite of hu_stuff.c and the HUD engine to streamline it 
and allow easier access by scripting. fraggle's widget system has
been expanded to include all of the HUD widgets, and has been altered
so that it acts like a class, with pseudo-inheritance and pseudo-
polymorphism. It's as close as you can get to OO in C.

Repaired player messages to use V_WriteTextColoured with the current
configured message color. Of course, this color is overridden by any
that might be in the string itself, so things like obituaries can
still have their separate settings even with this change. Previously,
for some bizarre reason, fraggle was only giving messages that orig-
inated from picked up items the proper color. I knew of this problem
a long time ago but put off fixing it.

Fixed possible error with how the messages are erased when the player
chat widget is active.

=====================================================================
05/30/05

Isolated and repaired one of fraggle's changes to vertical mouse
sensitivity which was causing it to have to be cranked up to almost
maximum in order to get any mlook response. Some people have
misinterpreted this as a problem with mlook when it's actually a
problem with the mouse input processing in G_BuildTiccmd.

=====================================================================
05/28/05

Isolated cause of yshearing-related sprite glitch after inspiration
by a comment SoM made about it seeming like the column coordinate 
value was out of sync with the scaled length and step values of 
columns. In all 17 of the column drawer functions, the following 
change had to be made:

  //frac = dc_texturemid + (dc_yl-centery)*fracstep; 
  frac = dc_texturemid + 
     FixedMul((dc_yl << FRACBITS) - centeryfrac, fracstep);
  
The first line is the original coord. calculation, which involves
the use of "centery", which is the center of the view window chopped
to an integer. With the new yshearing system, however, column
positioning is influenced by centeryfrac, which is fixed-point and
contains a decimal portion of the value lost by centery. Since this
calculation was still using centery, the coordinate was too coarse
and thus resulted in garbage at the end of columns.

Changing this also remedied the slight but noticeable jerkiness of
the new yshearing code. This was caused by the "chunky" increase and
decrease of the integer centery value.

Note: At least part of this calculation is constant across columns 
drawn for the same sprite. In zdoom, that part of the calculation is 
performed outside of the column drawers. This is a possible avenue 
for further optimization of the column drawer functions.

=====================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v3.31.10
=====================================================================
=====================================================================
05/26/05

Changed up to SDL_mixer 1.2.6, which finally includes the fix to
native MIDI volume setting which had been in SDL's CVS for well over
a year and had lead me to believe the existing code was in 1.2.5 and
still malfunctioning. However, the desktop volume setting is still
changed and left different, and I'm not yet aware of any way to fix
this, since SDL_mixer cannot query the MIDI volume without an active
MIDI playing. If I must, I may have to create a Win32-specific module
to address that problem, which would open its own MIDI handle, query
the volume at startup, set it appropriately to Eternity's setting and
store the original, and then change back to the original setting on
exit. Sounds like a big pain in the ass to me; the use of SDL is
SUPPOSED to avoid the necessity of stuff like that.

=====================================================================
05/24/05

Applied SoM's patches to the portal rendering code that enable proper
recursive rendering of anchored portals along with other fixes.
Final preparations for v3.33.00 launch are being made.

=====================================================================
05/20/05

Completed all parameterized floor line types:

   306 - Floor_RaiseToHighest(tag, speed, change, crush)
   307 - Floor_LowerToHighest(tag, speed, change)
   308 - Floor_RaiseToLowest(tag, change crush)
   309 - Floor_LowerToLowest(tag, speed, change)
   310 - Floor_RaiseToNearest(tag, speed, change, crush)
   311 - Floor_LowerToNearest(tag, speed, change)
   312 - Floor_RaiseToLowestCeiling(tag, speed, change, crush)
   313 - Floor_LowerToLowestCeiling(tag, speed, change)
   314 - Floor_RaiseToCeiling(tag, speed, change, crush)
   315 - Floor_RaiseByTexture(tag, speed, change, crush)
   316 - Floor_LowerByTexture(tag, speed, change)
   317 - Floor_RaiseByValue(tag, speed, height, change, crush)
   318 - Floor_LowerByValue(tag, speed, height, change)
   319 - Floor_MoveToValue(tag, speed, height, change, crush)
   320 - Floor_RaiseInstant(tag, height, change, crush)
   321 - Floor_LowerInstant(tag, height, change)
  
Unlike Hexen, all target types are supported with both raise and
lower, and instant motion is possible if the target height is in the
opposite direction of the indicated motion. Also unlike Hexen, all
line types can specify the texture/type change properties and crush
value.  Like Hexen, however, crush damage is now customizable through
these line types -- the crush parameter, if greater than zero,
indicates how much damage to do at each "crush event" (which occur
each time "leveltime & 3" is false).

Customizable crush damage required a change to PIT_ChangeSector and
its calling functions, as well as T_MovePlane, and parameter value
changes everywhere those functions were called.

=====================================================================
05/19/05

Brought Eternity's Small version up to 2.7.3 and applied a patch to
repair portability of AMX binaries to big-endian processors. Renamed
all Small natives, defines, and enumeration values to begin with an
underscore. All symbol names starting with an underscore will now be
reserved for engine use. Began work on parameterized floor line 
types. Changed the API and semantics of some Small natives to make
them better, before the APIs become public.

=====================================================================
05/01/05

SargeBaldy found another possible Look <-> Chase infinite recursion
caused by calling Chase from an attack state. Repaired the same way
as for seestate recursion.

=====================================================================
04/10/05

Had to add an elaborate set of functions to properly erase HUD 
center messages. fraggle neglected this in SMMU and it turned out 
they were leaving scraps on the border in smaller screen sizes (as 
for why I never tested this before, who knows).

=====================================================================
04/09/05

New mlook system is complete and flawless. Added a kludge to the HUD
code that nudges the crosshair up and down based on your pitch angle
to keep it matching more closely with where the player is aiming in
screen sizes other than maximum. I still don't know why exactly this
is a problem, but it's mostly taken care of now. I'm not aware of a
way to make it match exactly (I'm sure it would be very complicated).

=====================================================================
04/06/05

Promoted "allowmlook" variable to sync-critical status, requiring it
to be saved in demos and save games. This should have been there all
along, and I have noticed several other such variables that are still
not saved. I will have to catch them one at a time.

=====================================================================
04/05/05

Visual part of new mlook system is now complete, and work has begun
on getting the player to shoot where he's looking again.

Added an MSVC packing pragma and GNU C __attribute__((packed)) to
the MUSheader structure in mmus2mid.c -- although the structure is
by default aligned properly, this is by no means guaranteed. There
are actually a large number of instances where DOOM is using
structures not declared as packed to read/write directly to/from
file. This isn't portable and needs to be addressed eventually.

=====================================================================
04/03/05

Began rewrite of the mlook system to make it based on a true pitch
angle instead of a simple delta value to the center of the view
screen. View centering will now work correctly, but v3.31 demos 
recorded with mlook on will no longer function (it is impossible and
unnecessary to maintain both mlook systems).

Removed some unnecessary FixedDiv calls in R_SetupViewScaling. SoM
accidentally shifted up an integer and then used FixedDiv. Just 
dividing by the integer value works fine and is way faster.

Renamed the "yprojection" variable to "yaspectmul", which matches the
name zdoom uses for the y aspect-ratio multiplier, which must be used
in the calculation to transform the player's pitch angle into a pixel 
offset. Fortunately, yprojection had been added earlier to support
multiple resolutions. DOOM itself never had any use for that value as 
far as I know, and thus didn't calculate it.

=====================================================================
04/01/05

Added SoM's awesome code for blood particles that drip to the ground
and then slowly fade. Altered it to use the style flags I added a 
while back that automate those kinds of effects, and also to happen
randomly along with the existing "cloud of blood" effect, so that
there's more volume.

=====================================================================
03/14/05

Tripped onto some bugs in ExtraData. The "tag" field was using a
string for its default value when it was an integer field, which
resulted in the value 15628 being put into every record that didn't
specify a tag -- this value was the string's address truncated to a
short. Also, a loop was assuming that lines have 8 arguments when
they currently have 5 (this may be increased if I find I need more
arguments, but right now 5 is the most I've needed, and is the same
as in Hexen and zdoom). This was resulting in an infinite loop in
E_EDLineForRecordNum, caused by the "next" and "recordnum" fields in
maplinedefext_t getting overwritten with zeroes. As long as there was
only one ExtraData linedef record, this wouldn't happen, so these 
bugs were hidden until now, revealed by a change to my param lines

While adding tweaks to the linedef activation system for parameter-
ized specials, I found an oversight in SoM's plane shooting code that
allowed 2S line specials to still be activated when a bullet passed
through a floor or ceiling in front of them. The problem was DOOM's
assumption that a 2S line with the same floor and ceiling heights on
both sides of it could not possibly stop a bullet. When allowing
planes to stop bullets, this isn't sufficient -- the bullet must 
always be clipped against the actual line opening.

Changed P_ShootSpecialLine to take a line side argument, and changed
P_UseSpecialLine and the button changing code to allow param lines to 
be used from the back side. Added a 1SONLY extflag for param specials 
to restrict a line's activation to being used/hit/crossed from the 
first side only. Normal line types are not affected by any of these
changes.

Removed a number of redundant "line->sidenum[0] != -1" checks that 
were scattered throughout the game engine. Lee patches such invalid
lines at startup in the P_LoadLineDefs2 function, so checking for
them during play is unnecessary. There may still be a few of these
checks left, but it's ok since they don't *hurt* anything.

Removed a redundant check on "underwater" in R_FakeFlat. The check
was probably accidentally left by Lee when he rewrote the deep water
lighting code for MBF. I found this while reformatting the code and
removing a couple of signed/unsigned conflict warnings. This is one
of only a scant few changes I've made to r_bsp.c the entire time I've
worked on Eternity :)

Added some new routines to my qstring pseudoclass: M_QStrUpr, 
M_QStrLwr, and M_QStrCreateSize. Eventually this class will probably
include just about everything you can do with a string, but I'm 
holding off on most of it until I actually need them. There's no use
having a million functions that aren't actually used.

=====================================================================
03/12/05

Rewrote various parts of the MapInfo parser to get rid of some ugly
hacks left over from SMMU, including one potential buffer overflow
involved in extracting the variable token from an assignment. This
also fixes the bug I found where the last line of the lump wouldn't
be parsed unless it ended with a line break. qstring helped me a lot
with this.

=====================================================================
03/10/05

SoM, who has returned from his short programming vacation for a 
while, fixed some issues with anchored portals. They can now be made
to work two-way, and they can work inside of each other as well
(which I believe they were meant to do originally, but did not).

He made a very impressive test map and posted screenshots on his
website. Unfortunately, some people on Doomworld have misinterpreted
the map as having true ROR, so we may be dealing with some unhappy
campers after v3.33.00 release :P

SoM also still wants to work on getting mobj_t's to be able to tele-
port through anchored portals. I know there are a ton of issues in-
volved with this, but I hope we can iron them out and make it poss-
ible, since spatially connected anchored portals would basically be
like ROR.

=====================================================================
03/01/05

Added two new types of parameterized doors, WaitClose and WaitRaise,
which are like the "close in 30 seconds" and "raise in 5 minutes"
sector types, but triggerable from lines. The only real difference
with these doors are how the same fields are setup at the beginning,
so it only took a few lines of code to add them.

This brings the current parameterized line special list to the 
following:

   300 - Door_Raise(tag, speed, delay, lighttag)
   301 - Door_Open(tag, speed, lighttag)
   302 - Door_Close(tag, speed, lighttag)
   303 - Door_CloseWaitOpen(tag, speed, delay, lighttag)
   304 - Door_WaitRaise(tag, speed, delay, countdown, lighttag)
   305 - Door_WaitClose(tag, speed, countdown, lighttag)
   
These 6 line specials implement more or less every type of vertical
door possible. I will continue the implementation process by moving
on to floors, ceilings, stairs, plats, lights, etc., until all
functional catagories are covered. At that point, loading Hexen maps
via runtime conversion will not be out of the question.

Added ability to separate tokens within EDF compressed frame fields
with commas instead of pipes. The result is more readable according
to several users (including SargeBaldy) who requested it.

=====================================================================
02/28/05

While testing ExtraData, I discovered that loading lumps into 
libConfuse was broken again. At some point I forgot to add a call to
the lexer_init function in cfg_parselump.

Added calls to P_ActivateParamSpecial to P_UseSpecialLine, 
P_ShootSpecialLine, and P_CrossSpecialLine. All processing for param
types is done inside P_ActivateParamSpecial, so the param specials
aren't subject to any of the quirks or limitations of the original
linedef special system.

The extflags field now supports the following values:

   EX_ML_CROSS   = 0x00000001, // crossable
   EX_ML_USE     = 0x00000002, // usable
   EX_ML_IMPACT  = 0x00000004, // shootable
   EX_ML_PUSH    = 0x00000008, // reserved for future use
   EX_ML_PLAYER  = 0x00000010, // enabled for players
   EX_ML_MONSTER = 0x00000020, // enabled for monsters
   EX_ML_MISSILE = 0x00000040, // enabled for missiles
   EX_ML_REPEAT  = 0x00000080, // can be used multiple times
   EX_ML_1SONLY  = 0x00000100, // activates from 1st side only
   
Unlike in Hexen (and zdoom), CROSS/USE/IMPACT/PUSH are combinable.
This allows the same line to be triggered in multiple ways. My first
test map contained a door you can both shoot and use, and the multi-
ple trigger methods in no way interfere with each other.

Also, unlike Hexen, PLAYER/MONSTER/MISSILE triggerability statii are
de-wed from the special activation type, allowing them to be indepen-
dently combined.

Finally, unlike Hexen, these flags go into a new field, and not the
almost full normal line flags, so there's no danger of running out of
line flags any time soon -- there are still 24 free bits in the
extflags field, and I don't even have any planned uses for them yet.
This is the real power of ExtraData finally showing itself.

I should note that MISSILE|IMPACT isn't implemented yet, and the PUSH
activation type isn't implemented at all yet. These trigger types
require a hack to P_TryMove that I've not had sufficient time to
consider yet. I don't particularly like the way Hexen does it and I
fear it might have issues in Eternity if implemented the same way.

Changed EV_TurnLightOnPartway to accept a line tag instead of a line
pointer, so that param special doors can use an alternate lighting
tag and so that specials started with no line don't have to have this
feature disabled for them. This function was only using the line for
its tag field anyways, so this changes absolutely nothing.

Added ability for non-Push type doors to be treated as manual, so
that zero tags for such doors don't result in the entire level
closing like a door. This only applies when param specials are in
action, so compatibility is not affected.

=====================================================================
02/26/05

Added ExtraData linedef record. Added new line fields args and 
extflags, for parameterized line special support.

Format of the linedef record follows:

   linedef
   {
      recordnum = <unique number>
      special   = <number> | <simple name> | <generalized specifier>
      tag       = <number>
      extflags  = <flag list>
      args      = { <string>, ... }
   }
   
The special field is the most interesting. All of the original and
extended normal line types have been given names, although some of
them are very hideous (like W1_Plat_Up32_c0t_Slow) -- I don't anti-
cipate these will be used much. Generalized lines can be specified 
with the following type of syntax:

   Gen<type>(<arg>+)

   <type> = Floor|Ceiling|Door|DoorLocked|Lift|Stairs|Crusher
   <arg>  = <char>+','

The arguments taken are values like "W1", "yes", "CloseWaitOpen", 
etc., based partially on the BOOM generalized linedef specification
documentation in editref.html -- this probably won't be used much
either, but it is provided for completeness. It took a hell of a lot
of code to implement, too >_<  These types of specials are parsed
with a finite state automaton lexer similar to the one used to parse
cmp frames in EDF, so they're very lenient with formatting.

Finally, param specials have very nice names that can be specified
in this field, names like "Door_Raise" and "Door_Close". The argu-
ments to these types of specials go into the args list, and may be
strings of arbitrary format -- currently the strings are only 
interpreted as numeric values, but this is likely to change in the
future to allow prefix:value pairs like in EDF (the code is already
setup to allow this when it becomes useful).

And of course, you can always just use the line special's number if
the names don't suit you.

=====================================================================
02/24/05

Work has begun on parameterized line special support. Changed the
hack case for raiseIn5Mins doors to use the new constant plat_special
for the direction they're moving in. This allows the value to be
used elsewhere consistently.

=====================================================================
02/23/05

Tweaked 3DMidTex clipping even further to allow things to be pushed
off them by explosions and weapon fire, and to allow dogs to jump
down from off of them. Also made the is/is not on 3DMidTex decision
for purposes of ignoring dropoffs more rigorous. This didn't seem to
affect behavior in SoM's Ogro Power Facility or in various test maps
in any way.  Attempted to eliminate things sliding across 3DMidTex 
when dead by disabling torque simulation for such objects, but it's
not enough. They also slide because they are corpses, and this 
behavior would be very hard to correct given where it is handled in
the code. I haven't given up yet, but I have put it off until much 
later.

=====================================================================
02/21/05

Changed previous patch to problem of particle events/effects going
off during the boss brain explosion by adding a new internal thing
flag MIF_NOPTCLEVTS which disables events for a thing. The things
are now given this flag by the Boss codepointers and also have their
effects field zeroed, which eliminates both rocket trails and rocket
bursts.

Added PS_FALLTOGROUND particle style flag, which causes a particle
to live forever until it hits the ground, at which point it starts to
age normally. This flag is needed for some of SoM's enhanced effects
that still need to go in, as well as those Millennium effects I
promised to get to a long time ago.

=====================================================================
02/18/05

Added another change to MIDI:

* I_ShutdownMusic now both stops and frees any currently playing song
  rather than simply stopping it. There's a small chance that exiting
  without freeing the music causes a resource leak in MCI which, 
  after repeated executions, could cause undefined behavior. It
  doesn't appear that SDL_mixer accepts responsibility for releasing
  native MIDI resources when it shuts down.
  
* A song will not be played if a song has not been loaded (shouldn't
  happen).
  
Also, after stress testing began to indicate that the native MIDI
code in SDL_mixer is rock solid after all (except when dealing with
rare, malformed MIDI files), I began to look for issues in the sound
effects engine, which was taken from prboom 2.0.2, and has already
had a large number of bugs fixed. Here's what I found:

* There was a possible race condition between the game engine and the
  I_SDLUpdateSound callback, which may or may not be called from a
  different thread depending on the platform and sound drivers being
  used by SDL_mixer. If a channel's data pointer was modified between
  the time I_SDLUpdateSound checked it for validity and the time it
  actually used it (which is several times within its loop), the
  SDL_mixer thread would unquestionably crash. This race condition 
  would tend to be rare and would be highly inconsistent, just like
  the crashes I've been getting ever since v3.29 Gamma added sound
  effects in Windows. This was fixed by placing a lock on the channel
  currently being processed by SDL_mixer. Until that lock is lifted,
  the other sound engine routines trying to use it must block.
  
I also added some paranoid checks here too:
  
* Added channel bounds checking to stopchan.

* Added null sfx pointer check to addsfx.

* Added null stream pointer check to I_SDLUpdateSound.

With all of this, the sound code should be getting more robust. I
don't doubt there are still some problems hiding in it, though. If
so, they'll have to be slowly rooted out just as these were.

=====================================================================
02/17/05

After several SDL_mixer-related crashes I have again re-examined the
MIDI playing code and I am also using a custom application to stress
test the native MIDI code from that library.

I have applied the following paranoid revisions to the SDL music 
code in order to ensure that nothing can be done that is inappropri-
ate:

* I_SetMusicVolume should never be called if a song is not currently
  playing. The native_midi_setvolume function in SDL_mixer doesn't
  test the HMIDIOUT handle it uses for validity, and the handle isn't
  valid when a song isn't playing. The MSDN docs for midiOutSetVolume
  do not say that behavior is defined with an invalid device handle, 
  so this isn't safe.

* Music won't be halted if no music is playing (shouldn't happen).

* Music won't be unloaded if no music is loaded (shouldn't happen).

* Music will be stopped before being unloaded (should already be 
  stopped before call to I_UnRegisterSong).
  
* Music will not be loaded without unloading the previous music
  (shouldn't happen).
  
Because some of the native MIDI routines are intolerant to being
called out of order, these paranoid checks make sure they can never
be called out of order, eliminating any concern about that.

=====================================================================
02/09/05

Added the ability to load and parse EDF from wad lumps. I'm not sure
what I was thinking earlier, because with a slight adjustment to my
custom version of libConfuse I was able to let EDF "cross-talk"
between wad lumps and files as much as it wants. First, I had to make
cfg_lexer_include provide loading from data or from file as an 
option, which was simple -- it was previously only allowing inclusion
of lumps from lumps, and files from files, but there's no need for
that restriction at that point in the code. Then, I altered the EDF 
include function to have this behavior, since it can only load files
from other files (it has to interpret the path relative to the 
current file). To make up for that deficiency, I just added a 
lumpinclude function that always includes lumps. So, you can use the
include functions in the following ways:

include
* From file: can only include another file
* From lump: can only include another lump

stdinclude
* Always includes a file from Eternity's directory

lumpinclude
* Always includes a lump

bexinclude
* Cannot call from within wad lumps (an error message will be given)

This gives almost full flexibility to the system, and circumvents the
problem of having the defaults already established as being stored in
files, since stdinclude can still get to them even from lumps.

The root EDF lump must be named EDFROOT, and it can include any
number of lumps of arbitrary name. If an EDFROOT lump is present, it 
takes precedence over any other form of EDF root file specification.
I can see this as being problematic, though, as people using EDF 
lumps might want to substitute in a file to test a temporary idea --
I'll think about how to make this work better before the next 
release.

Made adjustments to M_GetFilePath so that it is more rigorous. It now
properly distinguishes between paths relative to the root directory 
and paths relative to the current working directory, which it did not
previously do under my last rewrite. It should now return the proper 
path for all possible absolute and relative file name strings under 
DOS/Win32 and Unix-based OSes.

=====================================================================
02/08/05

Implemented additive translucency for sprites and screen patches, so
now you can have those burning-hot fireballs like zdoom has. I didn't
use zdoom's code directly since Eternity still uses an 8k lookup 
table; I had to figure out how to do it with the lower precision, 
which wasn't difficult and ended up pretty much the same. I'm still
satisfied with the look obtained with an 8k lookup so I don't plan on
changing that any time soon. It also allows me to claim descendence
of the code from DosDOOM and avoid any possible licensing issues ;)

In the process of this, I found another bug in SoM's column buffering
optimization -- single pixels at the top and bottom of the "common" 
area of a quad column flush would be drawn twice when the columns had
areas above or below the common area. For normal sprites, this wasn't
noticeable. For translucent sprites, it was negligible. But when it
happened with additive translucency, it was horrible, since the 
intensity increases so much with each overdraw. The simple fix 
involved removing off-by-one errors when drawing the tops and bottoms
of such columns. The R_FlushSingleColumn calls should run to 
commontop - 1 and from commonbottom + 1 respectively, since the quad
flush already draws the pixels at commontop and commonbottom.

Also added a BOOM-style translucent column drawer with translation
support. They never added this in BOOM, so if you, for example, made
the player translucent, he would always be green no matter what. I'm
not sure why I neglected to fix this until now, I guess it just 
slipped my mind after addition of the flex-tran system, which has
always provided a TR/TL column drawer.

Rewrote part of R_DrawParticle to remove major inner-loop invariants.
I have a feeling the compiler was probably fixing this already in the
optimizer, but there's no harm in doing it myself and being sure 
about it. Basically, I was making the same translucency decisions on
every iteration, and that was stupid. Of course, the function is 
quite a bit longer now, since removing the invariants required the 
inner loop to be duplicated 3 times ;)

=====================================================================
02/05/05

Corrected the allocation level of the TERTYPES lump. It was being
loaded at PU_CACHE, but then subsequent allocations were being made
before work with it was done. This could have messed up, although it
was extremely unlikely to ever happen due to how the zone heap works.
This has been wrong since the very first internal SMMU-based build of
Eternity, and it's never triggered an error the whole time.

Changed the gamemode info system so that the intermission objects are
dealt with in the same manner as the status bar objects -- the game-
mode-specific functions they point to are now static, and the objects
themselves are declared in their respective modules. The interfns_t
type is now defined in in_lude.h rather than d_gi.h.

=====================================================================
02/02/05

Added unscaled block drawers for solid and translucent blocks of a
single color. I added these to support the new intermission features
discussed below. The next feature of this sort to add will be masked
block drawers to support rect blit fonts.

Added EDF variables that manipulate behavior of the intermission.
intermission_pause specifies a time in gametics that the intermission
waits after drawing the background but before starting to show the
statistics. intermission_fade and intermission_tl specify an optional
color and translucency level to overlay the background picture with
once the optional wait period has expired (if no wait period is
specified, the overlay happens immediately). These two features
together allow me to emulate the Contra III intermission for Chex
Quest III, but I think other people will like them too ;)

=====================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v3.31 Delta Pre-Release Alpha 2
=====================================================================
=====================================================================
01/19/05

Fixed up various things in d_main.c, including an inappropriate use 
of AddDefaultExtension in the GFS code that probably could have 
caused a crash, or at the least, would have malfunctioned in the form
of returning a bad GFS file name.

=====================================================================
01/17/05

Changed Eternity to use a minor revision version system instead of
public beta releases. From now on, I'll just be incrementing the
subversion until I think the next number should go up (and it should
have done this a long time ago, but whatever :P). Perhaps this will
relax those who think that beta copies of Eternity are too unstable
to use, which hasn't been true since the horrors of v3.31 beta 1.
Eternity has been increasingly more stable since that point, and has
not crashed on me (while not in development) since then.

=====================================================================
01/14/05

Finished the unified font engine in the new module v_font.c -- This
combines code that was previously duplicated in v_misc, mn_engin,
hu_over, and mn_htic to provide a single, uniform interface for
drawing fonts. A few special cases had to be mainlined, but this only
improves the flexibility of the system. The "big" font can now be
enabled for DOOM gamemodes simply by providing the proper FONTB*
lumps.  I'd like to provide a default FONTB for DOOM in eternity.wad,
but I'm a bit short on graphics for it at the time being.

I also intend to add support for fonts that are stored inside of a
single graphic and copied to the screen with rect blit operations.
This will require addition of masked block drawing functions in
v_block.c, more than likely, and so I haven't even begun to tackle it
yet. I find myself wishing I could use SDL's blitting like I do in
RayCaster, but alas, that won't work here for various reasons.

SargeBaldy noticed that the vpo_threshold console variable wasn't
working. As usual, I forgot to actually add the command to the
console command chains with C_AddCommand.  I kinda wish there was a
way to automate that, because I forget it almost every time I add a
variable or command.

=====================================================================
01/11/05

Added the graphical hud for DOOM, which is actually a part of the
status bar and reuses its health, armor, and ammo number widgets. I
had to add a couple of semi-hacks into the status bar code to get it
to allow this, but it was very easy and didn't dirty up the code at
all. The most work was spent getting it to draw numbers outside the
normal status bar background area and to disable the blitting of 
parts of the status bar background behind the numbers, and of course
to get it to draw the widgets in the proper locations at all times.
They wanted to jump back and forth on me at first due to some small
errors in the code.

=====================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v3.31 Delta Pre-Release Alpha 1
=====================================================================
=====================================================================
11/16/04

I got sick over the weekend, so the second alpha release I had hoped
for got delayed a bit longer. Today I've done a little work in the
config file code, reformatting a bit of it, adding the vpo threshold
variable, and adding a new variable that lets you disable the appli-
cation of gamma correction to screenshots, a feature that Lee added
but not everyone likes. It will be nice to be able to take normal
screenshots without changing your local gamma setting.

=====================================================================
11/11/04

Big day for bug fixes:

1. 3DMidTex thing clipping is now repaired. The solution? Drop offs
must be COMPLETELY ignored when a thing is standing on (or under??)
3DMidTex lines, otherwise proper clipping is impossible. This is done
by setting the tmtouch3dsides flag in P_LineOpening and then when it
is set in PIT_CheckThing, setting tmdropoffz equal to tmfloorz,
effectively stating that there is no dropoff to be considered. This
prevents the engine from even considering allowing the thing to jump
off in the normal fashion, and allows our own code segment that looks
strictly for floorz differences of 24 units to catch all things on 
3DMidTex lines. It took both SoM and I working together to come up
with this final fool-proof solution.

2. I noticed a while back that P_CheckPosition seemed to be broken
when I saw some Maulotaurs respawning inside each other in Heretic 
while in Nightmare mode. I saw this again recently with some imps in
DOOM II MAP01 and so I knew there was a problem. I fired up a test
map and spawned a demon, killed it, and stood on top of it, and sure
enough, whammo, I'm stuck inside it as soon as it comes back. 

I debugged the program and stepped through the P_CheckPosition call,
and what should I find except that the code is working perfectly as
it is written -- it's just written incorrectly, and the problem has
been there since, guess what -- BOOM. I tested this in WinMBF to be
certain (finding an unrelated bug in it in the process) and sure 
enough, standing on a dead thing in Nightmare mode nets you getting
stuck inside it. SargeBaldy also complained that Archviles were
sometimes getting stuck to things they respawned, or the things were
getting stuck to other things in their vicinity. I knew these were
clearly related.

I wonder how no one has noticed this bug in all this time, as it is
apparently in every BOOM-descendant source port. I checked prboom and
its code does not compensate for this error, which turns out to be a
result of Lee's fix to allow non-solid things to move through solid
things inside the PIT_CheckThing function. P_CheckPosition doesn't 
take account of whether or not a thing is moving, and thus treats 
Nightmare and Archvile respawns the same as walking. This isn't 
appropriate, since the non-moving things being considered WILL be
solid when respawned. I have currently repaired this problem by 
setting and unsetting the SOLID flag on the target objects around the
calls to P_CheckPosition when demo_version is >= 331. Demo compatibi-
lity for DOOM demos was already fortunately intact due to a check 
inside PIT_CheckThing.

This is not an ideal fix to this, however. A better fix would be a
way to tell P_CheckPosition about whether a thing is moving or if it
is a non-solid being considered for respawn, but since the actual 
check on the SOLID flag is done in PIT_CheckThing, an iterator func-
tion called by P_BlockThingsIterator, the information cannot be 
easily passed down to it except through an ugly global variable, and
I do not want to introduce any more of those to the clipping code,
which is already a labyrinthine nightmare.

=====================================================================
11/09/04

SoM made improvements to moving 3DMidTex lines to allow more flexible
tagging and therefore more complex structures possible. This lets his
3D elevators in Lava Factory have independently movable guard rails.

=====================================================================
10/28/04

Removed my earlier -workdir hack and replaced it with new Win32-
specific code in i_fnames.c -- this code utilizes the 
GetModuleFileName and PathRemoveFileSpec API functions to get at the
real fully-qualified name of the Eternity process's EXE file. Unless
these API functions are also broken under Windows XP, which I find
unlikely, this should much more naturally resolve the issue of files
not being found when the frontend starts Eternity on that platform.

D_DoomExeDir currently calls WIN_GetExeDir only when compiling under
Visual C++.  I can add support for other compilers if it is also an
issue for them (I am unaware if this problem affects the MinGW 
build).

=====================================================================
10/08/04

Fixed Cyb's outstanding crash issue -- it was caused by a zero-length
sound lump. They are not technically valid, but there's no reason
they cannot be accepted as meaning silence by simply playing no
sound, which is what the code now does. prboom already fixed this at
some point, apparently, as it did not crash when playing Cyb's map.

BTW, I am aware that zdoom once had a problem with such lumps, but it
was not the same as my problem. That problem was caused by an attempt
to allocate a huge amount of memory, whereas my problem was actually
an out-of-bounds index into a lookup table caused by the computed
padded size of the sound being a negative number.

=====================================================================
10/04/04

Added support for percentage values in the EDF translucency field for
thing types. Percentages must be base 10 integer numbers between 0
and 100, with the last digit followed immediately by a % character.
All non-percentage values are still interpreted as numbers on a 
scale from 0 to 65536. Note the percentage is phrased in terms of
the percentage of the foreground graphic that is used, as opposed to
background. This is the same as other engine translucency metrics,
so 100% is, in this case, not translucent at all, and 0% is 
invisible.

=====================================================================
09/29/04

Added the ability to customize the visplane overflow threshold used
by the SMMU VPO detector HUD widget. As discussed in several places,
this detector cannot be exact due to optimizations made in BOOM's
visplane splitting algorithm (DOOM generated many more visplanes than
it needed to draw a scene, which only exacerbated the effects of the
static limit placed on them).

Finally got around to removing the weird hack that Dave Taylor put
into ST_Responder which allowed the automap to notify the status bar
when the game was changing into or out of automap mode. The code to
do that did NOT belong in ST_Responder, and the notification messages
were being sent in via hacked event_t structures that contained 
values which were assumed to not alias any valid input. This made an
unnecessary AND-op and branch in ST_Responder on every single input
event, which is gross considering the nature of the hack. Created a
function called ST_AutomapEvent which the automap code now calls
instead of ST_Responder.

=====================================================================
09/26/04

Added the ability to reskin monsters with a new sprite via the EDF
field "skinsprite." Monsters with a valid skinsprite will use that
sprite value instead of any value which is in the frames they enter
(with the exception of the S_GIBS frame, because enemy skins are
cleared when a thing is crushed, and restored by an Archvile if it
resurrects such a monster).

Now you can have monsters which act the same but look different with
a minimized EDF thingtype definition which simply inherits from the
original type and sets the skinsprite.

=====================================================================
09/14/04

Eliminated all unused state enumeration values, converting the enum
to use assigned values for the states that are needed. This makes
maintaining EDF much easier.

=====================================================================
09/13/04

Fixed ANOTHER bug in the Heretic Imp's crashstate logic. If an imp
hit a raised floor after calling the ImpXDeath1 pointer, it would
enter its crashstate without ever calling the ImpXDeath2 pointer.
This would cause it to keep the NOGRAVITY flag and hang in midair
forever. This bug was in Heretic.

Split the code in R_FlushColumns to create R_ResetColumnBuffer, which
is now called from the main rendering loop instead of R_FlushColumns.
This moves some redundant variable-clearing code out of the column
drawing line of execution (the most critical line in the engine).
Although the column quad cache rendered us a higher FPS, the code as
is has a lot of room for futher optimization.

=====================================================================
09/12/04

Optimized the flex tran code in r_draw.c by calculating and caching
pointers to the tran lookups when the first column is cached, rather
than when every single column is flushed. All the columns in cache
must share the same flex tran lookups, or they'll be flushed, so it
remains constant during that time.

Split up R_GetBuffer into several different functions which are
called from the different R_DrawColumn versions. This allows maximum
use of known information to minimize the number of branches. These
functions are candidates for future inlining, as they are very small
now.

=====================================================================
09/11/04

Fixed a bug in the column flushing code where it used the wrong
tranmap for BOOM-style translucent columns.

Unrolled a loop on a constant value in R_FlushQuadColumn and then
reordered the function calls made within it to be in closest screen
order, hopefully reducing possible CPU cache misses.

=====================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v3.31 beta 7
=====================================================================
=====================================================================
08/22/04

EE v3.31 'Delta' pre-release alpha will launch today. I'll let it
stay up for a few days, wait to see if any problems are reported, and
then I'll upload the final EE v3.31 release to /idgames. This is 
mostly to avoid the curse I suffer of uploading something only to 
find I left out one file, or a single line of the EDF is wrong, etc.
I'm otherwise fairly confident that EE v3.31 is stable and has very
few bugs.

=====================================================================
08/21/04

Added the ability to specify an alternative working directory over
the command line using the parameter "-workdir". This is made necess-
ary by bugs and compatibility problems in Windows XP which are break-
ing the frontend.

Not only does Windows XP's crt0 deliberately strip the absolute file
path off of the exe name in argv[0] -- the CreateProcess API function
on that system also fails to properly set the working directory. So,
it is literally impossible for Eternity to figure out the appropriate
place to get its files from when started by the frontend.

I'll have to release a new frontend version that implicitly uses the
-workdir command line parameter instead of only trying to set it via
CreateProcess. It'll probably follow shortly after 3.31 Delta release
since the change is very minor.

I fixed the bug with explosions tangent to 3DMidTex lines by using
SoM's suggestion of checking against mo->secfloorz instead of
mo->floorz. The secfloorz field, which SoM added, always has the
sector's floor height, whereas floorz may be modified by 3DMidTex
lines.

=====================================================================
08/20/04

Absolute final preparations are being made for the pre-release
alpha of Eternity Engine v3.31 'Delta' -- Delta is the name I
decided upon for two reasons: first, it comes after Gamma, but 
second, it also stands for change in math, and Eternity is really
changing and beginning to come into its own now.

I completed beta versions of the MapInfo and ExtraData documentation
today and during the past few days. It feels so good to have this
stuff documented and completely ready for use by editors at long 
last.

=====================================================================
08/16/04

I was play-testing Heretic a bit more and found that the imps had
a couple of oddities with the crashstate:

1. If an imp died above a floor but drifted into another sector where
   its z coordinate was EXACTLY equal to the floor, such that it 
   never moves even 1 unit in the z direction, it could miss going 
   into its crashstate. P_XYMovement must also check if a thing 
   should enter its crashstate. This is done when the thing is no 
   longer moving on the x or y axes and is at the floor z. This
   error happened by the yellow key area of Heretic E1M1. The imps
   there often spawn on the floor.
   
2. Under just the right circumstances, a dead imp falling down stairs
   or off a short ledge could enter the crashstate twice. I believe
   this happened in Heretic too, but I've fixed it by making the
   ImpDeath and ImpXDeath2 pointers set the MIF_CRASHED flag so that
   the movement functions won't cause a re-entry into the crashstate
   when a dead imp is sliding. So now you shouldn't get two sets of
   imp chunks from one imp, no matter what ;)

I added the NOSPLASH flag to a few Heretic objects that really
shouldn't splash, like PodGoo. Way too many sounds going on when pods
blow up over water :P
   
Somehow I managed to get stuck into an Iron Lich today when he
tornadoed me on a lift. Not good, but the situation in which it
happened was so esoteric and extreme that I'm not worried about it.
If anybody can find a commonly creatable circumstance where you can
get stuck into things with z clipping turned on, then we can worry.
Until then, no. I doubt it'll ever happen again unless the exact
circumstances are recreated.

=====================================================================
08/15/04

A while ago I got a bug report via email saying that dog jumping was
broken, but I dismissed it at the time. Well, today I tested it my-
self, and sure enough, dogs never jumped down.

I found a code segment in P_TryMove which SoM added for 3DMidTex 
lines. Unfortunately, it broke dog jumping (and possibly some other
stuff too). I had to comment it out for now, and I think the only ill
side-effect is that monsters walking on 3DMidTex lines can hang a
little bit too far off the lines, which just looks a little odd. If
this cannot be fixed without breaking other stuff, we'll just leave
it be. Things already hang off normal ledges a lot, even with Lee's 
falling physics, so I don't think it's a big deal.

There's another bug with explosions that take place on the top
surface of 3DMidTex lines -- they trigger terrain hits no matter how
far above the real floor they are. Unless there's a reliable way to
distinguish when a thing is and is not above 3DMidTex lines, I
don't know how we're going to fix that.

=====================================================================
08/14/04

Finally applied SoM's patch to fix the spectre fuzz problem. The code
wasn't caching the proper colormap to use when flushing fuzz columns,
so it could get munged up.

=====================================================================
08/12/04

Repaired some minor but annoying sound bugs related to external
cameras. Fraggle's sound code adjustments didn't always use the
camera as the point of reference for sound, so sometimes sounds could
pop back and forth between the player and the camera. This was only
really noticeable with the chainsaw.

Also, it seems like S_AdjustSoundParams could have dereferenced a
NULL listener. I'm not sure how this hasn't caused problems in the
past, but I added a check for it anyways.

=====================================================================
08/08/04

I fired up BOOMEDIT.WAD today to do some final rounds of regression
testing (because I DO need to release really soon). Guess what should
appear but a gaggle of previously undetected bugs!

1. Deep water ceilings clip off the bottoms of sprites, even when the
   242 ceiling is even with the floor. This looked like a bug at
   first, but technically it isn't. 242 flat sprite clipping is and
   MUST be more rigorous than the normal interaction of sprites and
   flats. Normally a thing can extend into a floor practically as far
   as it wishes and it will be displayed. In order to have proper
   behavior with 242 effects however, the sprite must be clipped
   exactly. There is no easy way to detect the case where a thing is
   on a floor exactly even with the 242 ceiling within the sprite
   rendering code, and so I cannot change this. Even zdoom has the
   same behavior here.
   
2. BoomPushPoint and BoomPullPoint were broken, causing the point-
   source effects to work only intermittently and only at close
   range to the objects. Believe it or not, this was an EDF error.
   When I wrote InfoConv, a hacky little program that turned the
   info.c data into the initial Eternity EDFs, I assumed that all
   the mobjinfo entries had integral radius and height values. Alas,
   the radii and height of the BoomPushPoint and BoomPullPoint 
   objects were only 8 for some reason, and not 8*FRACUNIT -- this 
   means they should be 0.0001220703125, not 0.0 -- the change broke
   the visibility test on these objects done in the pushing thinker
   code.

3. The chasecam can still act iffy on some deep water boundaries. I
   dunno if I can make it any better or not. Now is not a good time
   for it, that's for sure. It will have to wait, possibly forever.
   (Can you tell I don't care about it very much? :P )
   
4. BOOM Extended sector damage types were broken because of a really
   stupid error I made in the (possibly temporary) code which chooses
   between DOOM- and Heretic-style nukage damage. Note that 
   currently, the game is using bit 12 of the sector type to indicate 
   that a BOOM extended sector should do Heretic-style damage. I 
   don't like this because it's not solving any problems; it's better
   than the system I had previously, which was hardcoded by gamemode,
   because it would let the user pick the damage type in any game-
   mode. I'm still not sure what the best combination of solutions 
   for custom floor damage will be -- I say combination because in
   the end, the sector type, TerrainType, ExtraData, etc. could all 
   have different means of providing damage values. The bit 12 toggle
   has never been documented and you should not try to use it. It is 
   very likely to disappear, as there aren't that many free sector 
   bits left and I think that toggling between 2 static damage types 
   using one is wasteful when more general solutions are possible.

=====================================================================
08/07/04

Finished adding the very last Heretic enemies, the Gargoyle and
Gargoyle Leader (the EDF and source call them Imps since I cannot
type Gargoyle over and over >_<).

Finally added the crashstate field to mobjinfo, and EDF support for
it. So now your dead falling monsters can switch into a different 
frame when they hit the ground (note: not useful with the DEADFLOAT 
flag at all ;)

I generalized the code in A_SkullAttack so that anything doing a pure
SKULLFLY attack can call it (this includes the Heretic Imp, but not
the Maulotaur, who does his charge a bit differently). The new
function is P_SkullFly.

I ripped out almost all the existing TerrainTypes and floorclip code
and replaced it with a new system, with some parts adapted from
zdoom -- some serious problems had crept in through the various 
versions and it was getting difficult to put up with it. Plus, if I
want to generalize the floorclip system to allow variable terrain
clipping or monster effects, it had to happen anyways.

Three things happen as a result of this:

1. TerrainTypes now work perfectly with deep water! When a normal
   thing descends past a deep water surface, a splash is formed there
   at that time. When missiles or bouncers cross the surface at all,
   they splash (so shooting up OR down through water causes 
   splashing).

2. Missiles now cause TerrainType hits. People requested this a long
   time ago, but with the state of the system I didn't even want to
   try it then. If you want a missile that doesn't splash, give it
   the flags2 bit NOSPLASH and it won't (that goes for anything else
   too).
   
3. v3.29 demos recorded with TerrainTypes on are forever broken.
   Sorry, it had to be done. I couldn't preserve the old system. This
   is much like when Lee ripped out BOOM's extremely inefficient
   thinker-based friction algorithm -- BOOM demos with friction 
   cannot play back properly either, but he had no way to preserve
   the old friction system without either some serious hacks or total
   code explosion. SargeBaldy estimates the number of v3.29 Gamma
   demos to be exactly zero, and so I really doubt this hurts anyone
   anyways. In some ways it is fortunate that Eternity has not seen
   much use yet. It lowers the compatibility woes when things have to
   be changed in fundamental ways like this (which is rare).
   
   Note that recording demos with beta versions of Eternity is 
   unsupported and always has been. I can't keep track of changes
   across betas, only across the major version number -- the code 
   would become impossible to handle otherwise. If you need to record
   a demo on a beta version of Eternity, you better keep that beta 
   version forever, because the demo will probably desync a few betas
   later.

=====================================================================
08/06/04

Added all the Heretic ammo objects, just for the hell of it.

=====================================================================
08/05/04

Eternity now officially has feature creep. I just can't quit adding
stuff ;)  After noticing what Heit did in zdoom, I added a function
called P_SubRandom, which can safely subtract two random values
without incurring ambiguity in order of evaluation. Lee Killough had
alreadly eliminated all such expressions, but he did so by adding
temp values everywhere, which while it worked fine, makes the code
look messy and less readable. P_SubRandom fixes that.

At some point I also went through and found anywhere that a thing is
thrusted along an angle and changed all those calculations to calls
to the P_ThrustMobj function. No use having a function like that if
none of the code uses it. Having small functions for these common
operations makes writing new code much faster and more uniform.

=====================================================================
08/03/04

Finalized various details on stuff done during the past week.

Added ability for Iron Lich whirlwinds to update their tracer to
the Iron Lich's new target whenever their current tracer goes bad.
This allows the Lich to "direct" its existing whirlwinds toward any
new target it acquires. This keeps them from spinning off into walls
prematurely and just sitting there until they time out (although they
still do that if the Lich doesn't acquire a new target that the
whirlwind can follow).

Added flags3 CANNOTPUSH flag and added it to everything from Heretic
that should have it. I'm not aware of any DOOM items that should have
this flag, as it mainly applies to objects that pretend to be
missiles but are not (like D'Sparil's blue sparks and the goo that
comes out of pods when you shoot them). The Eternity TerrainTypes
splashes do need it, but I really count them as Heretic things
anyways, since that's where they originated ;)

I am beginning the final stages of preparation for v3.31 final 
release. There is still a ton of documentation work to be done :(

=====================================================================
08/02/04

Added Heretic Iron Lich. Added codepointers AproxDistance, LichFire,
LichWhirlwind, LichAttack, WhirlwindSeek, LichIceImpact, and 
LichFireGrow.

Added a damage field to mobj_t which mirrors the value in mobjinfo_t.
This was necessitated by the Iron Lich's fire pillar projectiles,
which must do zero damage until they have become visible. This adds
more flexibility to the damage that things can do by making the value
writable and determined on a per-thing basis rather than per-thing-
type.

Added flags3 EXPLOCOUNT flag, which is used to keep Iron Lich
whirlwinds from blowing up like missiles until a certain condition
is met. That condition is when the object's special2 (counter 1)
field is greater than its special3 (counter 2) field. This flag is
rather situational and probably won't see much editor use.

Revised the CounterJump and HealthJump codepointers so that they can
support both immediate values and values from counters. Added more
operations to the SetCounter and CounterOp codepointers.

Added extended parameters to the MBF Scratch codepointer so that it
can get its damage value as a constant from Unknown 1 (as it always 
has), from the thing's damage field, or from a counter. This makes
it very flexible without breaking compatibility.

Added 2 new special effects to the HticExplode pointer -- Maulotaur
floor fire explosions and Timebomb of the Ancients explosions. True
that the Timebomb of the Ancients won't be in the engine for a while
yet, but that code's there waiting for it and can, of course, be used
by editors.

Finally eliminated all the commented-out and #if 0'd code in info.c,
reducing the file to nothing but some legacy comments and the
declarations of the sprnames, states, and mobjinfo pointers and 
their corresponding NUM* variables.

Eliminated all the unused DeHackEd number enumeration values for
mobjinfo. The remaining ones are the ones that are actually used,
and they use value assignments to make them keep the right values.
I want to do the same thing for frames, but I'm having trouble
finding out which frame enum values are used due to the sheer number
of them and because of the difficulty of isolating only frame enum
values in the source (even regexps catch a lot of identifiers that
aren't frame enum values).

=====================================================================
08/01/04

Added the dmgspecial field to the EDF thingtype and support for it in
P_DamageMobj. Added MaulotaurCharge and Whirlwind damage specials.

=====================================================================
07/31/04

Added SectorColormap Small function.

=====================================================================
07/30/04

Rewrote P_CollectThings and made it part of the new MobjCollection
system. This is another OO-like structure which is manipulated only
through functions which can be found in p_mobj.c -- this gets rid of
some of the weirdness such as use of a pointer-to-pointer-to-pointer,
and reduces some duplicated code in the segments that use reallocated
mobj pointer arrays.

Added Heretic Maulotaur, eliminating ETCMinotaurus and all of its
associated resources in the process. As stated earlier, almost all of
the Maulotaur's code was already in the engine. Added the flags3
INVULNCHARGE bit to resolve a fixme on the special treatment of
SKULLFLY'ing Maulotaurs which was #if 0'd out after the addition of
EDF.

=====================================================================
07/29/04

Added Heretic volcanoes. Added new codepointers SetTics,
VolcanoBlast, and VolcBallImpact.

Added a new parameter to the BeastPuff codepointer to allow disabling
the application of momentum to the puff objects.

=====================================================================
07/26/04

Added a failsafe to the Chase codepointer so that it cannot cause
infinite recursions when used in an object's spawn state.

=====================================================================
07/23/04

Got around to fixing a couple of issues in the menu system. String
console variables being subjected to input via the menu system, such
as savegame names, now have their current value copied to the tempo-
rary input buffer (except when on the savegame menu and the value is
"empty slot"). I also simultaneously fixed it to use the replaceable
"empty slot" string that is defined through DeHackEd, rather than a
locally defined copy of that same string. The DeHackEd string had 
been orphaned at some point and wasn't being used.

This removes the painful necessity of retyping the same savegame name
over and over every time you save to the same slot. I'm really not
sure why fraggle left this out, seeing that it was in MBF already and
the code to do it is only a bit more complicated than the code to
clear out the input buffer. This was a heavily requested feature, but
I put it off 'til now because (once again) I figured it was going to
be difficult to fix. It wasn't.

Also made a couple of the menu help messages (displayed at the bottom
of the screen) sensitive to menu key bindings. They'll tell you one
of the proper keys to press, rather than always displaying the engine
default of "enter". There's one I haven't fixed, though.

This is just misc stuff I'm mopping up while waiting to send the
source to SoM so he can fix the Spectre bug introduced either by
hires or by the column optimization code (he knows which but I do
not ^_^). Once that's done, we'll be ready to make preparations for
some beta testing and then the release.

=====================================================================
07/22/04

Moved par time determination code from g_game.c to p_info.c.

Finished implementation of global MapInfo lump support. The global
MapInfo lumps are named EMAPINFO (*not* MAPINFO to avoid future
Hexen conflicts!). As mentioned earlier, they cascade and allow the
latest definition for a map to become the one that is used. HOWEVER,
I did NOT use the libConfuse parser!

I started working on a libConfuse implementation, and before I was
even half done I had about 150 lines of asinine and redundant code.
I realized it wasn't going to work and trashed it all immediately.
Instead, I put some extra code into the existing parser that lets it
go into "global" parsing mode. It only adds about 10 or so lines of
code to the existing parsing functions, and works MUCH better.

Another obvious bonus is that the syntax is almost 100% consistent
with in-header MapInfo (the difference is that in global MapInfo, the
blocks are named for the maps they belong to (ie "MAP01"), and in the
in-header flavor, there can only be one block which must be named
"level info").

Did some minor testing of this, goofing with the START map and
several DOOM levels. It seems to work brilliantly, but of course it
needs a more thorough beatdown to be sure of its correctness.

But no, the format is not zdoom/Hexen-compatible. Sorry. >:D

This completes virtually everything in the code that is necessary for
v3.31 final release. ::ominous drum rolls echo like thunder::

=====================================================================
07/18/04

Moved the sky texture determination code from r_sky.c to p_info.c.

=====================================================================
07/17/04

Began the final changes for v3.31 final -- the implementation of the
global MapInfo lump. Support for map header MapInfo is not being
removed, but rather augmented. MapInfo embedded into map headers will
override the information provided in global lumps.

The global lumps will be additive, such that the definition for the
current map will come from the LATEST MapInfo lump, but other maps
can still come from prior ones. I am planning at this point to use
libConfuse to parse the global lump, so its syntax will be EDF-like
rather than the same as in-header info.

The first course of action was to put all the info_* variables into
a new struct (a long-standing TODO), the LevelInfo structure. This
didn't take long at all.

The second thing to be done, which will take longer, is "centralizing"
MapInfo such that it becomes the DEFAULT place to get map-dependent
information from, rather than an alternative to numerous other
sources scattered around the executable and determined one-by-one
through complicated decisions that muddy up the source code.

This process has been started by moving the f_finale code for deter-
mining the intermission text, backdrop, and music to p_info.c, and
also the automap level name code in hu_stuff.c to p_info.c.

I removed the commented-out list of sprite constants from info.h
(the old location of the static thing types and frames). I said a
while back I might leave that stuff for historical interest, but it
adds +200kb to the source code and thus eliminating it is a good 
thing IMO. People can just download the BOOM or MBF source if they
really want to sit and stare at the way things were once done ;)

=====================================================================
07/16/04

With the help of the zdoom source, I finally figured out what was
breaking the rising pit at the end of Heretic E4M1. For some weird
reason, Raven decided to make raiseAndChangeTexture plats go into an
eternal stasis after completing their action. As you may know if you
are an advanced editor, plats in stasis lock out any other floor
actions on the sector in question. This is why the pit at the end of
E4M1 does not rise more than once in Heretic, even though it would 
if you converted the map to DOOM.

For now at least, these types of plats will go into stasis when
playing in Heretic mode. It would be nice, of course, if a map author
could control that somehow.

=====================================================================
07/15/04

Finally added the PrBoom comp_stairs fix for MBF. Lee accidentally
munged comp_stairs up really badly, such that most levels wouldn't
even work under it if comp_stairs was on (but would without it).
I just decided to not spend a lot of time trying to exactly under-
stand cph's fix, and copied the ENTIRE new function from PrBoom.

I got around to this because someone finally found a map that broke
because of it under Eternity and bothered to complain about it to me.
If you need something fixed, please tell me.  I base my priorities
on the more minor stuff largely on user requests these days.

=====================================================================
07/14/04

Deleted the ClericSparkle Eternity TC object and its associated
states and codepointer. Absorbed the previous functionality of the
P_ClericSparkle function into the Heretic SpawnGlitter pointer by
adding some new parameters to it.

Added a new codepointer -- CounterOp. It lets you do an operation on
two counters and store the result in a third (any of the 3 involved
counters may be the same counter, too). This pointer makes the whole
set of Counter codepointers a complete assembly language for frames!
There are still a few things you can't do (ie store the result of a
comparison rather than jump on it), but I'll probably address these
based on user requests, since I cannot fully anticipate what is and
is not needed.

=====================================================================
07/08/04

Finally got around to adding a filter parameter to the cmdlist
console command, so now you can filter for commands that start with
a particular letter of the alphabet. I also fixed a masked bug in
that command -- if there had been any non-hidden commands that
started with the letter Z, they wouldn't have shown up because it
used a < where it needed <=. Of course, the only Z command is
currently z_print, and it is an undocumented debug command ;)

Fixed the MapInfo levelpic and endofgame to work properly under
most if not all circumstances. I became aware of the endofgame issue
after looking through the Caverns of Darkness source. Seems Joel
fixed the problem for CoD but forgot to tell me about it ^_^

=====================================================================
07/07/04

Added dynamic automap bindings, eliminating the automap key_* config
variables. Had to change some semantics in the key bindings system
slightly, as well as break up the logic in AM_Responder, for it to
work properly.

Twiddled the key repeat settings so that the delay is shorter and
the repeat rate is slower. Also verified that key repeat *should* be
enabled. Without it, a lot of stuff becomes irritating to use, and
it is always on under Allegro in DOS too.

Broke up the hideous mess in AM_drawWalls. Most of the insanely
complex predicates in that function have been scooted off into their
own static inline boolean functions. It is so much more readable now!

=====================================================================
07/06/04

Changed the SDL flags in i_main.c into a #define instead of using a
local variable. Stack space on the main line of execution should be
strictly conserved, as it can never be reclaimed during execution,
but will never be used again.

=====================================================================
07/04/04

Repaired a bug in the cast call system that would ignore sound events
which occured on the first missile or melee attack state.

=====================================================================
07/03/04

Began improvements to the key bindings system to support multiple
binding classes. Binding classes allow a single key to have multiple
bindings, as long as each one is in a different class. This restores
the BOOM level of functionality while retaining the SMMU flexibility
of being able to bind actions to more than one key.

Added dynamic bindings for the menu system and eliminated the menu
key_* variables.

Made the -cdrom code in G_LoadDefaults be conditionally skipped when
compiling under Linux, since -cdrom is currently broken for that
platform.

=====================================================================
06/24/04

Got around to rewriting the EDF compressed frame definition code to
relax the syntax of cmp fields significantly. They now allow arbi-
trary whitespace, which is ignored, and quoted values. Quoted values
allow stuff like BEX flag strings to contain characters that would
otherwise be ignored or cause errors (like pipes and spaces).

This is really how I wanted cmp fields to work from the beginning,
but I was in a hurry during the initial implementation because many
other things also needed to get done. This doesn't break any backward
compatibility; it only improves what can be done with the formatting
of cmp fields.

=====================================================================
06/21/04

See, I told you my pace was broken :(

I have been more occupied by my many other projects -- Dungeon
Keeper, CQIII, RayCaster, et al., and Eternity has been suffering
because of it.  CQIII development is going to need a new Eternity 
release, however, so I have a new incentive to get back to it.

Found out wads added via GFS don't set the "modifiedgame" flag,
because for some dumb reason, functions in d_main.c set that flag
every time they add wads to the game, instead of having such a flag
set somewhere in w_wad.c -- oh well, it's fixed now, and when a GFS
adds wads, the game will realize it has been modified.

Added code in w_wad.c to track the handle of the very first wad file
added to the game. This handle will always belong to the engine
resource wad (eternity.wad), and is therefore useful for figuring out
if the user has replaced something inside it.

This was needed to make the startmap auto-disable itself when new
wads are added, but ONLY if the startmap comes from the resource wad.
If a user modification provides its own startmap, then the game will
still be able to use it because of this. I didn't want to disable the
ability for user modifications to provide new startmaps, since that
is a potential editing feature, and one we might choose to exploit
for Chex Quest III, which is finally beginning to make some more
serious progress now.

After discovering that Eternity could attempt to call Small scripts
recursively after all, despite my efforts to the contrary, I was
required to rewrite the entire system for starting scripts, which has
put a significant delay on the release of the final version of EE
v3.31 (I estimate the delay will last the rest of the summer since it
has seriously broken my pace of work and discouraged me for a while).

Everywhere starting a script that could possibly be doing it recur-
sively must now test if the VM it is using is currently executing, 
and if it is, it has to create a child SmallContext structure which 
contains a clone of the VM and its own invocation data. These 
SmallContext objects create a tree (more of a chain, really), and as
each ends its execution, the data segment is copied back to the 
parent, and the parent continues.

It's unfortunate that the Small VM isn't already reentrant when using
the same AMX structure. For some reason, Thiadmer has kept the code
and the context married to each other, rather than allowing multiple
contexts to function over one code/data area, like languages such as
Lua can do. I'll admit to actually considering changing to another
scripting language again for about a day. But, I really LIKE Small
despite its few ultimately minor problems, and the amount of work to
change languages at this point would be astronomical once again. So
I put that idea out of my mind and proceeded to come up with that
elaborate and slightly hackish method of making Small behave as a
reentrant system.  I have yet to test scripts actually executing in a
reentrant situation, however, and I dread doing so.

=====================================================================
05/24/04

Finally added savegame support for the Small scripting system. The
levelscript and gamescript VMs both must have their data segments
saved.  Since Eternity doesn't support sleeping or waiting scripts,
there is no need to save the heap/stack or registers, and thus the
savegame code is significantly simpler than it would be otherwise.

The list of currently scheduled callbacks also has to be saved.
Although at runtime they are stored in a double-linked list, their
order is considered undefined and therefore I can simply relink
them on load.  This allows me to store them just like thinkers are
stored -- back to back with a special terminating value that tells
me when to stop reading.  So simple and easy I almost have to laugh.

With this, the last true obstacle to releasing a version of Eternity
with Small support for editing is eliminated.  The only things that
have to be done now are getting enough docs and tutorials done that
people can learn how to use it effectively, and of course, continuing
to add more native functions so that it can quickly catch up to and
overtake ACS and other scripting languages.  I believe I am well on
the way to this, but I must keep up my current fast pace.

Once all the natives are done, Small will be incredibly powerful;
this isn't just conjecture any more. It's starting to become a 
reality, and I'm very excited about it.

Added the ability for Small callbacks to pause under certain
circumstances. The SetCallback function now takes a flags parameter
that can specify those options.

=====================================================================
05/23/04

I should note that during the last month I have added a ton of
Small native functions, but have not been mentioning them in the
changelog. Mea culpa.

Finally figured out a SMMU bug that was causing Eternity to think
levels were new whenever you added a single lump file or played demos
using -file or -playdemo.  The code in w_wad.c that keeps track of
the IWAD's file handle would inappropriately reassign the IWAD
handle to any single file that was opened because it was using an
uninitialized variable (damn it, fraggle! :P)

Once again, SargeBaldy has helped me track down a demo sync problem.
fraggle made it to where Lee's autoaim toggling could be used in the
normal game and not just in beta emulation mode. The problem is, Lee
depended on the value of "beta_emulation" to keep autoaiming on
during old demos. When fraggle removed the beta_emulation variable,
he inadvertently opened up a situation for demo sync problems.

SargeBaldy was using a console script to force autoaim off at
startup, since Eternity didn't yet save this variable in the config
file (an issue directly related to this sync problem, as it wasn't
saved in savegames or demos either).  I've fixed it by, of course,
saving it in demos, savegames, and the config file from now on.

Sarge has been one of my most loyal users, and his concern over
improving Eternity's usability and demo sync have proven themselves
priceless over and over.  I definitely think he is on his way to
getting his name on the Special Thanks line of the help screen. He
deserves it as much as anybody who's there already, if not more.

=====================================================================
05/20/04

Made the pause at the end of execution optional, by user request.
The pause is there because Windows slams console windows for Win32
programs shut as soon as the program stops execution. This is rude
and provides no time for the user to read any error or exit messages,
making an at least optional pause necessary.

=====================================================================
05/16/04

By popular demand and because I think it is important for compatibi-
lity, I have restored the BOOM/MBF "traditional menu" feature, which
enables use of the original DOOM main menu.  This should fix problems
with various wads, including Hell Revealed 2, which rely on the
precise behavior of the old main menu to be usable.

The stuff that had to be done to emulate the old main menu fully
included defining the actual menu, causing it to be modified at run
time when in DOOM II, and then making the skull pointer behave
differently (in DOOM, it used an absolute hard-coded height to skip
to the next item; under fraggle's more intelligent system it auto-
spaces the graphics and skull positions using the graphics, but this
would break under wads like HR2).  I also had to restore the
"traditional_menu" config item and add a console variable for it.

I'd say it took me about 15 minutes, so my earlier concerns of it
being difficult were unfounded. Sometimes you just gotta try doing
something before you know what kind of effort it will take :P

=====================================================================
05/07/04

Removed old FraggleScript EV_OpenDoor and converted the EV_DoGenDoor
function to use the new EV_DoParamDoor.  Parameterized specials are
almost identical to BOOM extended linedef specials, except that they
allow complete customization of the parameters, instead of being
restricted to a set of speeds, heights, etc.  This allows Small to
create new effects without causing the code explosion which I had
previously feared.  The way in which the BOOM gen linedef code was
written is quite amenable to being extended in this manner. All I
have to do is add a new enum value after the generalized ones which
indicates to use a value which was passed to the function in an
"extended values" struct.  So for gen linedefs, the code segments
continue to function the same.  For parameterized actions, they can
get special values.

Rewrote EV_DoGenFloor to use the new EV_DoParamFloor. Same as above,
except for floors instead of doors. The Small FloorAction function is
needed by the start map, which I am working on restoring to full
functionality.

Found a BOOM bug which was in Eternity that was fixed by BOOM v2.02 
but missed by Lee (keep in mind that Lee was writing MBF while 
TeamTNT was still working on BOOM 2.02, so there are some inconsis-
tencies like this which still need to be caught).

The bug was an interesting one which was originally in DOOM. Floor
and ceiling actions that raise or lower by the shortest lower texture
would sometimes choose the wrong height if any sidedef around them
had the "no texture indicator", which is "-".  Internally, DOOM
remaps this to the number zero. 

The problem is that the first texture in the texture directory is
also number zero, and that happens to be the AASHITTY/AASTINKY which
are notoriously unusable.  The reason they can't be used is because
of this -- DOOM considers them to be the same as no texture.

The problem was in the check when lowering or raising floors and
ceilings. id forgot they used zero to mean no texture, and so it was
treating zero as if it were AASTINKY, and getting that texture's
height. If it was shorter than any of the other textures around the
sector, it would end up being chosen incorrectly.

BOOM fixed this for the DOOM function in v2.00 or v2.01, and thus the
original linedefs work properly when comp_floors is off. But, whoever
wrote the BOOM generalized linedef code that does the same thing
forgot to fix that bug there as well until Jim Flynn found it in 
v2.02. prboom didn't have this problem because it is based off of
BOOM v2.02, whereas Eternity is descended from MBF, which is based
on BOOM v2.01.

=====================================================================
05/02/04

Identified and repaired a possible crashing bug in Lee's LineEffect
codepointer.  It passed a locally declared dummy linedef to the
activation functions.  Unfortunately, some of the code called by
those functions ends up storing pointers to the line which triggered
the effect (ESPECIALLY for switches).  Since once A_LineEffect 
returns, the line doesn't exist in memory any more, this could cause
stack or heap corruption (the latter being extremely rare).

Fixed by making it static, but I must note with some concern that
activating line effects in this manner is just not a good idea. Yes,
the original source does it a few times for the 666/667 effects, but
then DOOM had a lot of stuff in it that shouldn't have worked, yet
did by either luck or because of DOS4GW. No future code I write will
allow use of linedef specials in this manner, since it could lead
to some unreliable side-effects on the rest of the map.

Found a dead structure type and function prototype in p_spec.h for
the old BOOM thinker-based friction model.  Lee rewrote this in MBF
but missed killing this stuff in the header.  I removed it all and
left a comment to note where it went.

=====================================================================
04/27/04

Rewrote HU_CentreMsg into HU_CenterMessage, adjusting it in prepa-
ration for use by Small (it was previously only usable via Fraggle-
Script, and didn't use the standard message duration). It also now
uses the qstring structure instead of maintaining its own reallocated
string. Thus continues my quest to get everything using qstring that
can use it.

=====================================================================
04/15/04

Added line continuation back into the custom libConfuse lexer, but
only inside quoted strings. This allows them to be broken across
lines, which may come very much in handy if I add the ability to
define completely new string values in EDF. This might become needed
to support other features soon. Replacement of builtin strings will
still remain a BEX-only feature, however. It's done there much better
than EDF would be able to do it, and there's no need to have the
same functionality in two places (plus there's bexinclude, which
really makes it like one place anyways).

This would also allow long frame cmp fields to be split across lines.
One has to be careful to preserve the terse syntax, however. Any
extra whitespace before the line continuance slash would mess up the
cmp field parser. Whitespace after the continuance is ignored, of
course, allowing the start of the next part of the string to be
arbitrarily indented (you could in fact even put in more linebreaks
without additional continuance symbols, but this is considered
deprecated and I won't document that ability, since it is detrimental
to the syntax).

=====================================================================
04/13/04

Added a bunch of new codepointers:

* SetCounter -- provides 12 different operations for manipulating
     the three internal "special" fields that things have
* CopyCounter -- lets you copy one counter to another
* CounterJump -- just like HealthJump, except it works on any of the
     three counter fields.
* CounterSwitch -- this is probably the most powerful decision-making
     codepointer possible, and it is equivalent roughly to an ASM
     jump table or C switch statement. You give it the DEH number of
     the first state in a block of consecutively-defined states, and
     then the number of states that are in that block. It then uses
     the zero-based value in the selected counter field to branch to
     one of those states. When used with the RNDMOD operation in
     SetCounter, this is MUCH better than using chains of RandomJump
     states. I immediately rewrote ChexBuddy's AI in the CQIII EDF
     to use this pointer, and it's much cleaner and makes him use
     his weapons more uniformly.

Fixed the V_DrawPatchTL calls to use a flex tran level approximately
equivalent to the BOOM tranmap level. Much to my chagrin, this was
forgotten in all the excitement before beta 7 launch.

Applied the final outstanding patch to the portal code to add anchor
type 299, which I ALMOST forgot to do.

Prepared all documentation for the new release.

=====================================================================
04/10/04

Made the last few minor adjustments required to compile the DOS
version and tested it out.  Seems to work like a charm.  However,
the assembly versions of R_DrawColumn and R_DrawTLColumn are now
out of sync with the C versions, and thus need to be adjusted to
work again -- but my x86 assembly skills are lacking.  I may have to
learn a bit more to fix them so that Eternity can remain at maximum
speed on that platform.

Added a new codepointer, HealthJump.  It allows frame transfers to
be controlled by the amount of health a thing has, and can compare
that amount against a given number in seven different ways.  This
is one of a few new "frame scripting" codepointers I intend to add.
Although Small will be able to do frame transitions eventually, I 
think these codepointers will prove useful for EDF mods even with 
scripting in place, because they are fast to use, allowing you to
remain in one language rather than jumping back and forth.

I really did want to release today, but various things, including my
allergies, got in the way, so it won't happen tonight.  Sorry!

=====================================================================
04/08/04

Finished work on V_TileFlat, which doesn't exist as a single func-
tion at all now.  The 2x version of this function won't work on any
buffer, however, because making it do so would have just made it
slower. The VBuffer setup function tests to see if the buffer is
really 640x400 or not, and if not, makes it use the general scaled
function instead.

Turned out V_PatchWrapperS wasn't exactly kosher, as it started
causing heap corruption again today.  SoM and I together nailed down
a series of small problems in the function, one of which was appar-
ently a sensitivity to some bad patches in Heretic (!!!). Now it
seems to work properly (and it might be a bit faster too).

Eternity now locks almost perfectly at 35 FPS in 640x400 for me,
something it didn't do before the rewrite. Since the major drawing
functions are all pointerized now (V_DrawPatch, V_DrawBlock, and
V_DrawBackground being the major 3), I can probably feel comfortable
with releasing a beta really soon, as in possibly tomorrow if I can
get everything ready fast enough.  I still need to fix a couple of
lingering DOS issues and test that build out. Hopefully no hidden
problems will be revealed.

Of course, the revisions to the drawing system are far from finished.
I'll probably be revising and tweaking various elements of it for
several versions to come, just to get extra speed here and there,
or to make some of the old code nicer.  We'd eventually like to be
able to draw directly to the SDL screen surface instead of triple
buffering like we have to do right now.  Some of the work I've done
in the past few days is amenable to having this happen in the future.

=====================================================================
04/07/04

Created module v_block.c

Added a v_mode command-line parameter so that you can override the
video mode stored in the config file, in case Eternity can't seem to
work in the current video mode.  You have to know the appropriate
number of the mode you want though.  I'll publish a list somewhere
before release.

Started rewriting the block drawing functions -- V_DrawBlock now 
works similar to the new patch system -- the proper version is called
from V_DrawBlock through a function pointer in the VBuffer object
passed to it (btw, I realized this is a form of polymorphism in C --
pretty sweet in my opinion).

When I started to work on V_TileFlat, which is the function that
draws tiled flat backgrounds for the menus and intermission screens,
I found something weird in the code that does the lowres, 320x200
drawing:

   for (y = 0 ; y < SCREENHEIGHT ; src = ((++y & 63)<<6) + back_src)
      for (x = 0 ; x < SCREENWIDTH/64 ; x++)
      {
         memcpy (back_dest,back_src+((y & 63)<<6),64);
         back_dest += 64;
      }
      
Since "src" is never used inside this loop, the statement
   
   "src = ((++y & 63)<<6) + back_src"

has no side effects, EXCEPT for incrementing y by one.  This means 
that it's doing a bunch of unnecessary work every time the top loop
iterates.

Now, I wondered why such a weird thing would be in this code, so I
started tracing back its history.  First I looked in MBF and as I re-
membered, Lee Killough had rewritten the code there to support hires.
I started to suspect that maybe he'd made a mistake, because it turns
out his loop for hires has the same increment statement for its outer
loop, but in that case, the inside of the loop DOES use the "src" 
variable.

So, I checked the same code in BOOM, and it was the original code
from Linux DOOM, which was a bit different. Here's what it looks
like:

   for (y=0 ; y<SCREENHEIGHT ; y++)
   {
      for (x=0 ; x<SCREENWIDTH/64 ; x++)
      {
         memcpy (dest, src+((y&63)<<6), 64);
         dest += 64;
      }
      if (SCREENWIDTH&63)
      {
         memcpy (dest, src+((y&63)<<6), SCREENWIDTH&63);
         dest += (SCREENWIDTH&63);
      }
   }

At first, this confused me even worse. You can see that their outer
loop does indeed only increment y. But, they have this weird "if"
statement outside the inner loop that tests if the screen width is
not divisible by 64. In a case that it were not, it would draw the
remaining fractional portion of the flat at the end of the current
row on the screen.  But, DOOM only had one resolution, 320x200.
"SCREENWIDTH & 63" is a constant expression which never changes 
value, so that "if" statement is NEVER entered.

So, it seems that either id accidentally put in some totally un-
necessary code, or this is left over from WAY BACK in the alphas when
DOOM was supposed to support several extended resolutions!

What's funny is that when Lee rewrote the code and realized that
test was unnecessary, he ended up accidentally duplicating the
increment statement of his hires loop in the lowres loop.  So even
though he got rid of one redundancy, he introduced another. I just
find that ironic somehow, and it's a great illustration of the some
of the many woes of maintenance programming :)

=====================================================================
04/05/04

SoM figured out the bug in V_DrawBlock. He was just initializing the
y coordinate to the wrong value by mistake.

=====================================================================
04/03/04

Created module v_patch.c

Rewrote and restructured all the V_DrawPatch functions so that the
proper version (unscaled, 2x scaled, or general scaled) gets called
through a new VBuffer object, which can represent the screen or any
arbitrary memory buffer.  Also moved the column drawing into
functions which are called through arrays of function pointers which
are indexed by the drawing type (normal, translated, translucent, or
translated and translucent).  This renders maximum flexibility for
combining the rendering types without requiring the basic patch
drawing loops to be duplicated over and over (while this solution is
a bit like the one in zdoom, I didn't borrow any of Randy's code this
time ;)

Rewrote some code segments to exploit the new VBuffer facility,
including most notably the console background code. It was previously
using a gross hack of temporarily redirecting screens[1] to its own
private buffer, then calling V_DrawPatch. VBuffers make that kind of
crap totally unnecessary.

I removed V_DrawPatchFlexTL and just made V_DrawPatchTL use the
flex tran table. However, I still need to fix some of the calls to it
so that they send in a value which is roughly equivalent to whatever
percentage the current BOOM translucency value is. This won't be
difficult, I just have better things to do right now.

=====================================================================
04/01/04

There won't be any April Fool's jokes in the changelog, so don't
worry about that :P

Preemptively repaired several problems in SoM's retrofitting of the
DOS video code to work within the bounds of the generalized drawing
code.  DOS still only currently has 320x200 and 640x400 modes.  I
might consider adding some more modes for it eventually, but that's
REALLY low priority.

Tweaked a few variables in i_video.c and r_ripple.c to make them
static where it was possible.  Also, reformatted the DOS i_video.c
file because it was still an ugly mess, with tabbed and untabbed 
lines freely intermingling, and several peoples' code-writing styles
all jumbled up.

=====================================================================
03/31/04

Initial integration of SoM's generalized drawing code to allow high

Changes since Eternity Engine v3.31 beta 5
=====================================================================
=====================================================================
02/28/04

Making final preparations for a leap year release of Eternity v3.31
public beta 6.

I updated the DOS and MinGW makefiles a few days ago, and there were
no major problems building either of those versions. The MinGW make-
file still desparately needs dependency information, and the info in
the DOS makefile is not perfectly up to date (so it is possible that
modifying a few headers could break some modules).  I really need to
find out how to auto-generate dependency information at compile-time
with GCC, because I know it can be done. fraggle showed me a makefile
that did this once, but I failed to fully understand it, and now I'm
not sure I even have it any more. It would certainly save a lot of
work.

=====================================================================
02/23/04

Continued addressing some user complaints in preparation for beta 6
launch:

1. Generalized DR door types wouldn't allow you to retrigger them
   while they were opening or closing already. Added some code to
   allow this outside of older demos. This kind of minor change
   doesn't justify a comp variable. Who *wouldn't* want the doors
   to function as expected, anyways?
   
2. The map console command would try to start any string given it as
   a map. This lead to some pretty weird behavior if you specified a
   non-existant map, or a lump that existed, but was not a map. It 
   now checks against both of these possibilities, and will report 
   an error message if you give it a bad map name.
   
3. When using -warp, the console would end up with scraps left over
   on the game border if the screen size was less than maximum.
   fraggle did some strange things to the startup code, and there
   was a dead segment in D_Display that should have been getting
   called to take care of this on the first frame that a map was
   rendered. Fixed by checking for autostart in D_DoomMain and 
   (re)setting certain variables to force a border redraw.
   
4. Made some changes so that SDL ignores mouse motion events until
   I_StartFrame has been called the first time. This keeps it from
   queueing mouse motion during startup -- including the call to
   SDL_WarpMouse in the video init -- and then having the player
   pointing off to some wild angle and/or moving around when a map
   starts using -warp. The DOS version may or may not still suffer 
   this problem. Needs testing, I suppose.

=====================================================================
02/22/04

Trying to make progress toward beta 6 release by mopping up some
remaining issues that have been noted by users. Also finding some
other odds-and-ends stuff to take care of.

Rewrote WriteCentredText (note British spelling, heheh) in mn_misc.c
to use the qstring structure instead of maintaining its own reallo-
cating buffer. I'm going to continue doing this until qstring is
used everywhere it can possibly be used.

Also fixed a minor issue where hitting backspace when on the first
help screen would play the "previous menu" sound, even though it
wasn't moving back to a previous screen. A very small oversight in
the menu logic ;)

Moved the particle floor clipping code to P_ParticleThink to complete
streamlining of R_ProjectParticle in response to the previous archi-
tectural change. This is a much more logical location for this code.
The fact it ended up in R_ProjectParticle in the first place was pro-
bably a suggestion that the projection system should have been re-
written much earlier.

=====================================================================
02/20/04

Repaired particles to work with portals by changing the particle
projection to be performed by sector, as normal vissprites are
projected.

Particles have to maintain sector links, and each sector has a list
of the particles that are in it. P_ParticleThinker updates the links
when it moves the particles. This is still significantly less than
what has to be done to maintain mobj position, and part of the
position setting was already being done in R_ProjectParticle anyways,
to get at sector properties such as light level and colormap. The
R_PointInSubsector call which was performed there is now unnecessary,
since particle_t has a subsector pointer.

This is going to come in handy for adding all those new effects I
have planned for Millennium too, since those effects require looking
at an always up-to-date subsector pointer in the particle (ie, a
particle which lives infinitely until it hits the ground, and then
begins to fade).

=====================================================================
02/19/04

Added support for a combined thingtype flags field to EDF. This
allows you to forget about which flags go with which fields, and was
one of the first user requests to be made with respect to EDF. It
just took me a while to come up with a good way to do it ^_^

I rewrote all of the DeHackEd flag parser code to enable this, and
cleaned it up quite a bit in the process. dehflags_t lists are now
terminated by a NULL entry, eliminating the need for a macro using
sizeof to determine the length of the list. All the thing type flags
are also now in one master list rather than three separate ones.

I also added two more fields, addflags and remflags -- these let you
add or subtract a flag list from the thing's current flags, and can
be used in both definitions and delta structures. I realized there
was a need for this a long time ago, but it really needed the above
feature to be finished first for it to be effective. Also, the new
addition of dynamic monster types to zdoom has provided me with an
impetus to get some stuff finished >:D

Changed the EDF thingtype doomednum field to not be inherited. This
makes the most sense to me.

=====================================================================
02/15/04

Tweaked my fix to the sky code again, so that it acts uniformly with
respect to single- and multipatch textures. Otherwise, "long" skies,
which wrap less often around the game world, would be detected as
multipatch textures and would not be stretched when they were short.

This does, however, place something of a limit on what type of
multipatch textures can be used as skies. If you have a multipatch
texture with a patch larger than the texture but which is supposed to
tile where the texture height cuts off, it will not work properly.

Since I have to cut the texture off at the max of the texture height
and the tallest patch height to support Heretic- and Hexen-style 
skies, I can't support general multipatch textures that are meant to 
tile at the texture's height, yet contain patches taller than the 
texture.

I highly doubt this will cause any compatibility issues, but it might
surface as an issue in the future. I'll probably add a note about it
to the sky transfer linedef docs in the editref.

=====================================================================
02/12/04

Completely rewrote the console script running code. It was a gross,
amateur-looking mess, mostly thanks to my early work on it to fix
bugs from SMMU. Now, it is a formalized finite state automaton lexer, 
and it uses the new qstring structure I have written, which provides 
very secure reallocating string buffers. This removes a static limit 
on line length, and fixes the bug where commands on the last line of 
the file would not be run, since they didn't end with a \n. (Thanks
to SargeBaldy for drawing my attention to this neglected code and the
last line bug).

Also rewrote the libConfuse lexer to use the qstring structure, since
the code that m_qstr.c is based on was originally the qstring code in
libConfuse 2.0 -- I have simply generalized and encapsulated it so it 
can be used throughout the engine. This is another unforeseen benefit 
of my having previously integrated libConfuse directly, instead of 
compiling it as a static library or even as a DLL.

Found out that my previous fix to sky textures wasn't totally right.
Tweaked the code further to be more correct. MBF's sky.wad example
works much better now.

=====================================================================
02/04/04

Upgraded the internal Small VM to v2.4.0 -- this version has lots of
fixes over the previous version, as well as a lot of new language
and VM features.

Added even more new Small natives.

=====================================================================
02/02/04

Added TID system for identifying mapthings in scripts. Restored
StartScript codepointer to full functionality, and added several new
Small natives to test out TIDs. Wrote a fixed point math module for
Small.

=====================================================================

Fixed the fastspeed field for thing types to accept floats in the
same way that the speed field accepts them. This is something I just
forgot to do when I originally implemented the new speed field
behavior.

=====================================================================

Added thingtype inheritance to EDF. E_ProcessThing is now potentially
recursive. When a thingtype inherits from a parent, it tries to
process the parent type first. If the parent type has already been
processed, then it's ok and nothing will happen. Otherwise, it'll
get processed, and recursively process any parent type it might have.

When a thing type inherits from a parent type, its own definition
will be treated more or less like a thingdelta, such that only fields
that are explicitly specified will override those copied in from the
parent.

The only attribute which is not inherited is the DeHackEd number.
This always has to be different, and must be resolved before thing
types are processed, thus it cannot be inherited.

Here's a small example that would create a new Baron enemy whose
only real difference is that he would be 50% translucent:

   thingtype MyNewBaron
   {
      inherits = BaronOfHell
      doomednum = 20001
      translucency = 32768
   }
   
As you can see, inheritance allows definitions for similar thing
types to be drastically minimized, and absolutely no copying or
pasting is required.

Note some changes had to be made to the speedset and nukespecial
code to allow for this, but they were very minor.

Identified SargeBaldy's problem in a number of crashing maps to be
zero-length REJECT lumps. Time for a lengthy explanation:

In DOOM, maps with zero-length REJECT lumps are accepted and run ok,
although possibly with undefined REJECT behavior (if I am right, the
REJECT would act differently every time you play the map). Although
all the REJECT loading code was the same as it is in Eternity, DOOM's
Z_Malloc would return a 32-byte block when you requested a block of
size zero. This is very odd behavior for any memory manager, and can
result in the type of undefined behavior I describe above.

In BOOM, the entire zone system was rewritten, and one change made to
Z_Malloc was to make zero-size allocations return NULL, as C malloc
and most other sane memory managers will do. This would, however,
leave the rejectmatrix pointer NULL, and since the reject-using code
never checks it for validity, it would segv the first time something
called P_CheckSight. Apparently, this problem is common to all
BOOM-derived source ports. prboom simply refuses to load such maps at 
all currently.

I have fixed the problem (for now at least) by adding code which
generates an "empty" reject matrix when the lump size is zero. It
allocates a buffer of the appropriate size for the map, then fills it
with zeroes (which means that the reject is not useful for helping
reduce line-of-sight calculations).

To be technical, zero-length REJECT lumps are NOT appropriate. The
behavior in the original engine is undefined, and really only worked
by accident. I believe part of the blame for utilities allowing zero-
length REJECTS rests on the Unofficial DOOM Specs, which incorrectly
say that the lump is "optional," which can possibly be interpreted as
meaning it is allowed to be of zero length. Technically, this is not
true, and the REJECT should ALWAYS be the proper size for the map,
EVEN if it is only filled with zeroes.

But, this problem is easy to detect and fix within the engine, so I
will allow it, mainly because it fixes maps which worked (albeit
inconsistently) with vanilla DOOM. 

My fix *could* be improved by actually building a meaningful reject 
matrix for the map, but this would require reject builder code to be 
added to the engine, and isn't something I want to undertake right 
now. Consider it room for possible future expansion.

Another crashing problem in the portal code was identified within the
past two days. SoM created a "bandaid" patch for the problem, but I
finally nailed down the real cause today to be child portals not
having their minx and maxx members initialized. Fix was simple.

Restored my earlier code to functionalize the portal creation code in
p_spec.c, and changed a chain of if/else if's in R_RenderPortals into
a switch. Also fixed a couple of issues such as missing "void" key-
words in parameter lists, and moved the rportal_t typedef back into
r_portal.h along with its struct.

=====================================================================
01/22/04

An initial problem in the portal system has been fixed and it has
been reintegrated.

I have had to change the way particles are projected, however. As of
right now, they won't work inside portals because of this. In order
for particles to be compatible with portal rendering, they would need
to be projected subsector by subsector, as other vissprites are
projected. This would be a major architectural change for the parti-
cle system, but I think it's probably the best direction to move in.

=====================================================================
01/20/04

Started portal code integration. Experienced problems immediately
which would not be resolved for several days.

Added code to z_zone.c which can print out the entire zone heap block
structure to file. This will be very useful in the future for de-
bugging and optimization. Also changed an assert call in Z_Init into
a RANGECHECK define and altered the code to make it the same as it
is in prboom. This "sanity check" code tests some zone system
invariants which must be true, or else the entire system will not
work.

=====================================================================

Fixed the graphic used on the video options menu to test translucency
settings for all game modes.

=====================================================================
01/14/04

Modified libConfuse to support ignoring text between conditional
function pairs. This allows an "ifenabled" function for EDF which
can weed out DOOM or Heretic definitions when playing the other
game mode.

Now, this raises some issues, which I have addressed as follows:

1. By default, when Eternity loads its own root.edf, it will enable
   only the current game mode. The other game modes will be disabled,
   thus saving a bunch of memory.

2. When user EDFs are loaded, all game modes are enabled by default.
   This allows for backward compatibility, and also allows user EDFs
   to explicitly shut off game modes using the "disable" function.
   
3. As for non-EDF mods which rely on the existence of Heretic stuff
   in DOOM, I haven't solved this yet, but I'm working on some ideas.
   For now you'd need to make a dummy EDF that includes root.edf,
   just to force Heretic definitions to be read. That's kinda silly.

=====================================================================
01/12/04

Continued adding stuff that I need.

1. Added MissileSpread, which I also discussed in the forums a bit.
   It lets a thing instantaneously shoot out N projectiles evenly
   over a given angular sweep (the sweep is always centered on the
   actor's angle with this pointer). This relieves editors from the
   duty of making large sequences of MissileAttack frames with only
   the angle parameter being different.
   
2. Rewrote the translation table code and added support for custom
   sprite translations.  Translation lumps are 256 bytes long and
   contain 1-byte indices (0-255) into the palette. This is the same
   format that's used by the BOOM hud/status bar CR* lumps, and also
   the same format used internally for player translations.
   
   Translation lumps must be between the new markers T_START and
   T_END.  If no T_START lump is found, no custom translations will
   be available.
   
   To use this in EDF, you specify the "translation" field in a
   thingtype, like this:
   
   thingtype <name>
   {
      translation = <number> | <lump name>
   }
   
   If a number is provided, the thing will use one of the internal
   player translations (valid numbers are 0 through 14, with 0
   meaning no translation, and the rest of the numbers being in the
   same order as the colors are for the colour console command -- if
   a number outside the range is provided, it gets wrapped into
   range automatically).
   
   If a lump name is provided, the thing will use the custom
   translation contained in that lump (if the lump doesn't exist
   between T_START and T_END, an error will occur).
   
   This is something else I had always been planning on doing, but
   never got around to. This project has given me an excuse to wipe 
   out a growing number of TODO's. This stuff ought to help Eternity 
   gain a bit more credibility in the editing world.

=====================================================================
01/11/04

Since I've been working on a new editing project of my own, I've
been adding some doo-dads which I've found myself needing. It would
appear that editing for your own port is a very good way to find out
what can be done to add more to it ^_^

1. Added the BulletAttack pointer which I mentioned on the forums.
   Now enemies can use custom bullets too ;)
   
2. Added a variable to EDF called doom2_title_tics. It lets you set
   the length of time that the DOOM II title screen shows. I imagine
   I'll be adding a lot more of these kinds of misc settings
   eventually, but this is the only one for now.
   
3. Added a new flags3 bit, SUPERFRIEND. This allows you to make a
   friend which won't ever attack other friends, even in retaliation.
   Sometimes really powerful friends just shouldn't attack at all,
   since they'll more than likely kill you. Plus, if a friend is a
   meaningful character, it may not make sense for him to retaliate
   (would Robin throw a batarang at Batman? I should hope not!).
   
4. Added a console command called whistle. It lets you teleport one
   friendly thing of a given type to your location. This was inspired
   partially by Lee Killough's changelog note on trying to make a way
   for the player to call his dogs. While teleporting is not what he
   envisioned, it is much easier than overriding the normal AI, it
   will work from anywhere in the map, and for some types of friends,
   it may be natural for them to be able to teleport to you. It's
   a lot of fun when used appropriately ^_^
   
I also discovered a very sinister bug which was preventing EDF from 
being loaded by GFS. The "M_GetFilePath" routine which I wrote a 
while back was starting its process one off the end of the 
destination buffer. Apparently I have been very lucky, since this 
function is called all over the place, and could have caused serious 
effects by corrupting other variables (which is what it was doing to 
the GFS structure's EDF file name).

=====================================================================
01/05/04

Applied schepe's patch to SargeBaldy et al.'s problem of the game
crashing when you alt+tab out of fullscreen mode. I_FinishUpdate
needed to check the return value of SDL_LockSurface. If the lock
fails, the surface is currently invalid and can't be written to.

It just so happens that a DirectX fullscreen hardware surface isn't
valid when you alt+tab out of an application using it, so this is
where the segv was coming from. Unfortunately, the SDL docs are
rather vague about when a surface could become invalid or what you
have to do to handle it, so I never put any contingency code in for
such an event. Thanks to schepe once again for fixing some of the
ugliest problems to ever visit us ^_^

=====================================================================
12/27/03

schepe helped figure out what was causing demo desyncs on so-called
"death exit" demos. fraggle juggled some of the level transition
code around such that the player wasn't getting marked as "reborn"
before P_SetupLevel was called. So, when he would be spawned at
level start, the same stuff that happened in DOOM would not happen.
Fixed easily by restoring the original code order. Doesn't seem to
affect anything adversely; this was probably just a mistake in SMMU.

=====================================================================
12/23/03

Finally fixed the LFN drag and drop issue. Problem wasn't with LFNs
in general, but with paths that had .'s in them. I was using strchr
to look for the extension, when I needed to use strrchr, which looks
for the requested character starting from the "right" end of the
string (ie where the file extension should be).
