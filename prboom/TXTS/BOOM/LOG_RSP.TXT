Here are the things I've changed/added:

11/20/98

1. Re-fixed Firelines
---------------------

It was discovered after the release of version 2.02 that hoover.wad's
graphics were screwed up. This was due to some nasty line-splitting in a
particular part of hoover.wad that was upsetting the Fireline fix.

Further study showed that firelines could be fixed by simply setting the
seg angles and seg offsets according to the rounded seg vertex coords. You
didn't have to try to reset the seg vertices back to the parent line, as
the previous fix attempted to do.

Introduced the -noadjust command-line flag. If this appears on the command
line, no seg adjusting occurs. If absent, seg adjusting occurs.

For saved games and demos, the state of seg adjusting (doing it, not doing it)
is saved in the headers and restored upon read. Any games saved, or demos
recorded, with BOOM versions less than 2.03 are NEVER adjusted when played
with BOOM versions >= 2.03 (this version).

1. Fixed Firelines
------------------

Firelines are another form of slime-trail. They occur when the rounding of
coordinates for lineseg vertices on very short linesegs introduces errors
in the calculation of texture scaling and span painting. Firelines typically
are shown as floor spans being painted up to the middle of the screen, and
ceiling spans being painted down to the middle of the screen. They're named
after the original sighting of fire textures in the wrong places.

The correction is to adjust 'bad' lineseg vertices that are 'off' of their
parent lines (from which they were split). Move them back 'on' to the parent
line, or at least as close as you can get. By using the length of the short
lineseg and the original angle of the parent line, you can get closer than
the rounded-off coordinates that you get out of the wad. These changes are
done during map setup when the segs are read in, so there's no affect on
gameplay.

Files affected: p_setup.c, r_segs.c, r_bsp.c


09/16/98

1. Fixed sound propogation across savegames
-------------------------------------------

Allowed sector_t.soundtarget to be saved across savegames. This field is a
pointer to a thinker that caused a sound to be propogated through the
sector. Monsters can then target this thinker. The field was getting cleared.

Solution was to serialize the thinkers a little bit earlier and allow the
sector-saving code to store the index of the soundtarget thinker. After
the saved game is loaded, the index is used to locate the actual address of
the new target thinker.

Files affected: p_saveg.*,g_game.c


09/10/98

1. Fixed "Stuck in DM Start" bug and re-fixed ice-bobbing bug
-------------------------------------------------------------

The code that reduced your bobbing while stuck against a wall and on ice
caused you not to be able to free yourself from a wall when mildly stuck.
A DM Start in TNT Pursuit, Map 25 is too close to the wall and exhibits
this problem. Id's code allowed for extra momentum buildup that would
eventually free you if you weren't too far embedded in a wall.

I backed out the original ice-bobbing code and replaced it with code that
still fixes the ice-bobbing problem, and still leaves you enough momentum
to free yourself when you're mildly stuck in a wall.

Part of the original ice-bobbing problem (which I did not know at the
time) was that you could build up so much forward momentum pressed against
the wall that when you went to back away from the wall, it took about 2
seconds to free yourself before you started to back up. The new code gets
rid of this problem as well.

These changes are NOT compatibility-wrapped because they key off of new
friction values which only exist in BOOM.

Files affected: p_map.c, p_user.c, p_mobj,c

2. Earlier self-check
---------------------

While p_map.c was open for #1, I moved the self-checks in the
PIT_StompThing and PIT_CheckThing routines to the beginning of those
routines. The player is always checked against himself, and there was no
point to the other checks that preceded the self-check because eventually
the routines would have bailed out at the self-check. There were no side
effects prior to the self-check (i.e. global variables being set) so this
appears safe.

File affected: p_map.c


08/11/98

1. Fixed DM Weapon Pickup Bug
-----------------------------

Corrected the (new) corpse queue management code so it wouldn't leave
corpses from one map in the corpse queue when a new map was started.
When a new map begins, the mobj_t's of existing corpses are freed, but
the pointers to them in the corpse queue were left around. This affected
picking up a weapon (or any object, actually) when the queue thought a
corpse was in the same block as that weapon. When a player dies, and the
queue-management code wants to re-use a queue slot to make room for the
player's corpse, it frees the mobj_t of the previous corpse in that slot
and removes the corpse from the block links. In this case, since the corpse
doesn't exist, the weapon was removed from the block instead. Since the
weapon's mobj_t is still in the game, you can still see the weapon, but
you can't pick it up since it's no longer in the block.

The fix is to clear the corpse queue at the beginning of each map so 
the pointers to the (already freed) corpse mobj_t's no longer exist.

Files affected: p_setup.c, g_game.c, doomstat.h


05/16/98

1. Unknown Things
-----------------

Changed handling of unknown thing types from an abort with an error msg.
to a continuation with a warning msg posted to the screen.

File affected: p_mobj.c


05/14/98

1. New Player Starts
--------------------

Added Player Starts 5-8 using doomednums of 4001-4004. This complies
with DosDoom and other ports. These starts are ignored when spawning
Things, so 8-player support is NOT implemented.

Files affected: p_mobj.c, doomdef.h



05/12/98

1. MT_PUSH/MT_PULL
------------------

Modified OVER/UNDER height/radius table in info.c for the
change of numbers from 4001->5001 and 4002->5002.

2. OVER/UNDER
-------------

Removed OVER/UNDER code for final Phase I source release.
Here is a list of the files changed, with their rev numbers
just prior to the change.

1.9  d_net.c
1.4  doomstat.c
1.54 g_game.c
1.43 info.c
1.6  m_cheat.c
1.56 m_misc.c
1.21 p_enemy.c
1.34 p_map.c
1.22 p_mobj.c
1.13 p_user.c
1.12 doomstat.h
1.9  info.h
1.33 makefile


05/05/98

1. Documentation and Reformatting
---------------------------------

Added documentation to these files and reformatted them:

  doomdef.h
  m_menu.c
  p_map.c
  p_mobj.c
  p_user.c
  m_misc.*
  m_bbox.*
  d_event.h

2. Removed RECOIL and OPT_BOBBING defines
-----------------------------------------

Removed these from all the files where they appeared.


05/04/98

1. Player Bobbing
-----------------

Fixed problem where the player is pressed against a wall while on ice and
he's still trying to move forward with no success. The momentum code is
used to drive the bobbing effect, and--though no movement was occurring--
momentum was still present, causing bobbing to occur. The fix was to kill
momentum. Compatibility-optioned.

File affected: p_map.c


04/22/98

1. HU_Start
-----------

Added a call to HU_Start() when leaving the Setup Screens to pick up any
message changes that were made. Now you don't have to wait until the
next level to see the changes.


2. Reset to Defaults
--------------------

Added a button item on each of the Setup screens to allow you to reset values
to the default values. Also collapsed more of the code.

From the boom.txt file:

"8) Reset to Default Values

   A "Reset to Default Values" button appears in the upper-right-hand
   corner of each Setup screen (and on the first screen where there are
   multiple screens). When selected, this button blinks.

   This button allows you to reset all options on this Setup screen (or
   set of screens) to their default values. This is useful if you've
   made a number of changes that don't seem to work together, and you'd
   like to get back to a baseline.

   Pressing Enter will give you a dialogue box that asks you whether you
   'really' want to reset to the default values. Pressing 'N' exits the
   dialogue without resetting. Pressing 'Y' resets all values.

Note: Each screen has its own reset button. There is no single reset
      button that covers _all_ options that appear in all Setup screens. If
      you want to reset _all_ options to their default values, you'll need
      to activate each button separately."

Files affected: info.c, m_menu.c


04/14/98

1. Recoil, Bobbing, and Monster Remember
----------------------------------------

These items now take immediate effect when toggled from the Setup screens,
except if a demo is playing or being recorded, or a net game is taking place.
In those cases, the effect will occur later.

File affected: m_menu.c


2. #if PUSHER
-------------

Found this wrapped around an 'allow_pushers = true' in g_game.c.  Since
there's no -DPUSHER in makefile, and all push code is now enabled, I removed
the wrapper.

File affected: g_game.c



04/13/98

1. ESC and F1
-------------

Cemented ESC to the MENU action and F1 to the HELP screen action when
in normal game play. This ensures that a player can always bring up
the Main Menu and HELP screens if they get themselves into a key binding
bind.

Neither ESC nor F1 can be bound to another action that is available at
the same time as MENU and HELP. (I.e you can't rebind F1 to SAVE GAME.)

Files affected: g_game.c, m_misc.c, m_menu.c


04/12/98

1. New Setup Screens
--------------------

Added these screens:

    Enemies

        At the moment, this only has the 'remember' option. This is where
        any AI options should be placed in the future.

    Messages

        Options related to HUD messages (mainly colors).

    Chat Strings

        Provides the ability to change chat strings. String width is
        limited to what will display on this screen. DEL, left and right
        cursor movement, shifted keys, and overstrike are allowed. 


2. Setup/Help Screen Mods
-------------------------

Flopped the "SETTING|ACTION" description on all screens to be
"ACTION|SETTING". Most noticeable on the HELP screen, where groups had to
be rearranged to accomodate the flop. The Chat Strings caused this change,
since they look more natural the new way, especially when editing them.

Also consolidated the Setup Screen keystroke handling code and tables
so that common code paths and table structure could be used. Trimmed 600+
lines of code. Needed to see all the Setup screen possibilities before
doing this.

Files affected for #1,#2: m_menu.c, m_misc.c, info.c, d_main.c



04/04/98

1. Joystick Support
-------------------

Added support for joysticks. Calibration needs to be done using ASETUP so
that the joystick information is available in allegro.cfg. Support is for
up to 4 buttons. Used a CH Flightstick Pro, so will watch for any incoming
problems from different types of joysticks.

Verified rebinding of joystick buttons 1-4, and use of joystick to navigate
the menu screens.

Files affected: i_system.c, i_video.c, m_misc.c, g_game.c, m_menu.c


2. Main Menu Order
------------------

Per user suggestion, rearranged ordering of Main Menu to place more often-used
items at the top.

Tested with Doom shareware, Doom, Ultimate Doom, and Doom2.

File affected: m_menu.c


04/03/98

1. Placed a border around the outside of the color palette in the Automap
setup screen.

Added a "don't show" symbol (X) in slot 0 of the palette. When this is
chosen, the color is set to zero, which the Automap code interprets as
"don't show".

Allowed slot 247 to be active again (it was CYAN) and to represent pure
BLACK, since that color is no longer available in slot zero.

Files affected: m_menu.c, info.c


04/01/98

1. Fixed two Seg Violations caused by dereferencing NULL pointers in the
Setup menus. These are only seen when running in DOS Mode. Running in
a Win95 DOS window does not show the problem.

2. Added Automap screen to the Setup menus. Now you can set automap colors
using a color palette rather than changing the numbers in BOOM.CFG.

Files affected: m_menu.c, info.c


03/30/98

1. Extended HELP Screens
------------------------

Added user-defined HELP screens.

If you press ENTER while on BOOM's dynamic HELP screen, and HELP01 has
been defined in a PWAD, HELP01 is displayed. From there, repeated ENTERs
will display HELP02, HELP03, ... to an upper limit of HELP99.

File affected: m_menu.c


2. Setup Menus
--------------

Added the first few of several Setup Menus. They can be reached via the
"Setup" item on the Main Menu.

When on a Setup screen, these actions are allowed:

    Up Arrow and Down Arrow move you from one item to the next.

    ENTER highlights an item and lets you change it. Any item that gets
    changed is immediately in effect.
   
    Left Arrow brings up the previous screen if present.

    Right Arrow brings up the next screen if present.

    Backspace leaves this Setup screen and brings up the Setup menu.

    ESC leaves Menus entirely.

(Of course, if you rebind the keys used with menus, you can perform the
above actions with the new keys...)


The Setup Menu now contains

    Key Bindings

        All bindable actions are represented in groups.

        If a key is bound to an action, and that key was previously bound
        to another action that could be performed in the same input 'mode'
        then the two bindings are swapped. I.e. if F1 brings up HELP and F2
        brings up SAVEGAME, and you bind F2 to HELP, F1 will move over and
        be bound to F2.

        (Binding multiple keys to the same action should be possible in
        Phase 2.)

        You can bind mouse buttons in the same manner as keys, but in
        Phase 1, you're limited to the run, strafe, use, and forward actions.
        Phase 2 should expand these to _any_ action.

        Joysticks aren't supported at the moment, but are represented...


    Weapons

        This is mainly where you can define your weapon preferences. As in
        Key Bindings, if you plug a weapon into a slot, whatever was there
        moves over to where the new setting came from.


    Status Bar / HUD

        Nothing unusual here.


Files affected: m_menu.c, info.c, d_main.c. (D_main.c was changed to support
taller menu graphics by redrawing the status bar more often.)


03/25/98

Fixed headsecnode use that was misusing memory. Required
setting it to NULL when a level started.

File affected: g_game.c


03/21/98


1. Pushers
----------
Changed all pusher code to use controlling linedefs. Removed all the old
code that was using constant values based on sector special types.

The effects have been expanded, and are controlled by new linedef types
and an on/off switch in the sector type.

Constant pushers
----------------
Two types of constant pushers are available, wind and current. Depending
on whether you are above, on, or below (special water sectors) the ground
level, the amount of force varies.

The length of the linedef defines the 'full' magnitude of the force, and
the linedef's angle defines the direction.

         line type  above  on   under
         ---------  -----  --   -----
   wind     224     full  half  none
current     225     none  full  full

The linedef should be tagged to the sector where you want the effect. The
special type of the sector should have bit 9 set (0x200). If this bit
is turned off, the effect goes away. For example, a fan creating a wind
could be turned off, and the wind dies, by changing the sector type and
clearing that bit.

Constant pushers can be combined with scrolling effects and point pushers.

Point pushers
-------------
Two types of point pushers are available, push and pull.

The previous implementation of these was SECTOR-SPECIFIC. The new
implementation ignores sector boundaries and provides the effect in a
circular area whose center is defined by a Thing of type 4001 (push)
or 4002 (pull). The effect will not occur if there is no line-of-sight
from a 'candidate' Thing to the center point.

You now also don't have to set any option flags on these Things. A new
linedef type of 226 is used to control the effect, and this line should be
tagged to the sector with the 4001/4002 Thing.

The length of the linedef defines the 'full' magnitude of the force, and
the force is inversely proportional to distance from the point source. If
the length of the controlling linedef is L, then the force is reduced to
zero at a distance of 2L.

The angle of the controlling linedef is not used.

The sector where the 4001/4002 Things reside must have bit 9 set (0x200)
in its type. If this is turned off, the effect goes away.

Point pushers can be combined with scrolling effects and constant pushers.

Affected files: p_map.c, p_spec.c, makefile, st_stuff.c, g_game.c,
m_misc.c, p_mobj.c, p_user.c, p_spec.h, doomdef.h, info.c, info.h,
p_mobj.h, p_saveg.c.


2. Msecnode Freelist
--------------------
Nodes that are used to populate the touching_sectorlist and
touching_thinglist lists are now retrieved from and returned to a freelist
of nodes. When a node request is made and no nodes are available, a new
one is Z_Malloc'ed. Nodes are never Z_Free'd until the level is finished.
This should improve performance, but probably won't be noticeable.


3. Resurrected Monsters Sticking Together
-----------------------------------------
The Archvile resurrection code checked to see if the candidate corpse would
fit in the space around it. Corpses are considered non-solid (so you can
pass through them) so they would always fit, even if they ended up sharing
space with a neighbor after resurrection.

This bug is fixed.

File affected: p_enemy.c


03/20/98

1. Friction
-----------
Changed all friction (ice/sludge) code to use controlling linedefs.
Removed all the old code that was using constant values based on sector
special types. All features prior to this build have been carried over
(bouncing off walls, overcoming inertia from a dead stop, proper effect
when hanging out over ledges, etc.).

Now, to use increased or decreased friction, a new linedef type (223) is
available. The length of the linedef controls the type and magnitude of
the friction variance. Lengths from 1->99 are used for sludge-like sectors.
(A length of 67 is equivalent to the sludge effect in prior builds.)
A length of 100 gives you normal friction. Lengths from 101->200 will
give you icy floors. (A length of 189 is equivalent to the icy effect in
prior builds.)

The controlling linedef should be tagged to the sector(s) where you want
the effect. The special types of the sectors should have their FRICTION_MASK
bit turned on. (ox100) See log_jff.txt for details on generalized sector
types. One quick way to turn off the effect is to have a switch that
changes the sector type in a way that turns that bit off. You could
then have a 'change floor texture and type' switch that 'melts the ice' in a
sector, and turns it from icy to normal. Or a 'change floor texture and type'
switch that 'freezes' the floor, creating ice.

If there is more than one controlling linedef for a sector, the one with
the most friction will prevail. (Sludge beats ice.)

Details on a new structure needed for all this to work
------------------------------------------------------
Sector_t has a thinglist that is a linked list of every object whose
center point is in a sector.

I'm interested in knowing the complete list of objects that either are
partially in a sector or are entirely in a sector. This would be a
superset of 'thinglist'.

Thinglist works nicely because the links run through the mobj_t's of the
objects, so it's easy to add and delete objects from the world by playing
with these links.

In converting friction and pushers from Thing control to linedef control,
I've found that I can't rely on 'thinglist' to handle all the cases that
will arise as moving Things cross sector boundaries. For example, assume
sector A and sector B share a linedef, and A's floor is higher than B's
floor. A player perched on the linedef could have his center point in B,
but his feet on A's floor. A search through A's thinglist won't find him,
so any sector A effect won't be applied.

To deal with this problem, I've created a new structure

typedef struct msecnode_s
    {
    sector_t*          m_sector; // a sector containing this object
    struct mobj_s*     m_thing;  // this object
    struct msecnode_s* m_tprev;  // prev msecnode_t for this thing
    struct msecnode_s* m_tnext;  // next msecnode_t for this thing
    struct msecnode_s* m_sprev;  // prev msecnode_t for this sector
    struct msecnode_s* m_snext;  // next msecnode_t for this sector
    } msecnode_t;

We create a new 'thinglist' called 'touching_thinglist' that links together
a set of these nodes, each node representing a Thing that encroaches on a
sector. (Whether its center point is in the sector or not.) 'thinglist'
then becomes a subset of 'touching_thinglist'.

We also create a second set of links through these nodes, call it
'touching_sectorlist', and add it to each Thing's mobj_t structure. As a
Thing is spawned and moves through the world, this set of links is used
to identify all the sectors the Thing encroaches upon.

In the following diagram, Thing N encroaches on sectors M and M+1.
Thing N+1 encroaches on sectors M and M+2.


                              Thing N          Thing N+1

                                                    =
                                             
When a Thing is spawned, a node gets created for each sector the Thing
appears in, and the node is linked into the lists.

When a Thing vacates a sector, a node is unlinked and deleted.

When a Thing enters a sector, a node is created and linked in.

When a Thing is in a sector both before and after a move, no nodes are
deleted or added.

When a Thing is removed, its nodes are unlinked and deleted.

Since movement is handled at the 'Thing' level, mobj_t->touching_sectorlist
allows quick access to all nodes belonging to the Thing.

Since sector effects are handled by Thinkers, and applied across all
Things in a sector, sector_t->touching_thinglist allows quick access to all
nodes of affected Things.

FUTURE WORK: Keep a free list of nodes. When a node is deleted, put it on
the list. When a node is needed, take it from the list. Only go to the
memory management routines when the free list is NULL.

1. Checked in a friction fix that should better deal with the fact that
player speed seems to affect how friction is determined. In a
constant-friction world, this doesn't matter, but when friction is
expected to change exactly at a sector boundary, it presents a problem.
This should fix Jonathan's problem of jumping over a high-friction area
but 10% of the time picking up high friction when landing on the other
(normal) side.

2. Adjusted the 'getting started' movement in a high-friction sector
to simulate a slow start but gaining your footing after about 2 seconds.
Suggested by Paul.

3. Set friction to the original value if the IDCLIP cheat is on, reported
by Gary.

4. Turned off any pusher effects if the IDCLIP cheat is on.


03/10/98

Checked in the following:

a) A friction bug fix similar to the previous one (neighboring sectors).

b) new cheat codes for friction (TNTICE), pushers (TNTPUSH), and over/under (TNTOVER). The global variables are still present, but commented out of the configuration code. I did not touch any of the savegame or demo code, so Lee can adjust the use of the globals to his liking.

c) a version of m_menu.c with the #defines removed from around the HELP code. This code now behaves in the manner described by LEESFIXES.

Here's the behavior at this point:

  ID Shareware [Read This]->ad       [Enter key]->old help
BOOM Shareware [Read This]->ad       [Enter key]->new help
  ID Shareware        [F1]->ad       [Enter key]->old help
BOOM Shareware        [F1]->new help [Enter key]->menu

  ID DOOM      [Read This]->ad       [Enter key]->old help
BOOM DOOM      [Read This]->ad       [Enter key]->new help
  ID DOOM             [F1]->ad       [Enter key]->old help
BOOM DOOM             [F1]->new help [Enter key]->menu

  ID Ult DOOM  [Read This]->old help [Enter key]->menu
BOOM Ult DOOM  [Read This]->credits  [Enter key]->new help
  ID Ult DOOM         [F1]->old help [Enter key]->menu
BOOM Ult DOOM         [F1]->new help [Enter key]->menu

  ID DOOM2            [F1]->old help [Enter key]->menu
BOOM DOOM2            [F1]->new help [Enter key]->menu


03/09/98

1. Fixed Bug in FRICTION Code
-----------------------------

Fixed a bug in the FRICTION code where you could pick up the friction value
of a lower sector if hanging out over the edge of an upper one. (Nasty
bugger to fix!)

Had to add a 'friction' field to mobj_t, so any savegames prior to this
are NG.

Modules affected: p_user.c, p_map.c, p_mobj.c, p_local.h, p_maputl.c,
p_mobj.h, doomdef.h


2. Seperately Bound Menu and Automap Keys
-----------------------------------------

Allowed menu, movement, and automap keys to be separately bound.

Modules affected: m_menu.c, m_misc.c, g_game.c, am_map.c


3. Invisible Sprite
-------------------

Added code--courtesy of Ty and Jim--to make the MT_PUSH Thing invisible.
(Prior to this it was a candle.) Gave MT_PUSH some height, width, and mass
to avoid possible math problems.

Modules affected: info.c, info.h


03/04/98

1. Dynamic BOOMHELP Screen
--------------------------

Shareware, DOOM1, and DOOM2 help screen are now dynamic. The key bindings
shown are what's current. The screen has been rearranged to group keys by
action. The plasma rifle, bfg, and ssg are not shown in shawareware. The ssg is
not shown in DOOM1.

This is wrapped by #define NEW_HELP_SCREENS.

Modules affected: m_menu.c, doomdef.h, makefile


02/27/98

1. Player Bobbing is now optional
---------------------------------

Player bobbing can now be controlled by the player_bobbing config option.

This is wrapped by #define OPT_BOBBING.

Modules affected: m_misc.c, p_user.c, makefile


2. Weapon Selection
-------------------

Put gamemode wrappers around SSG, plasma, and BFG at selection time
so that selecting these in registered DOOM or shareware DOOM will not
cause a Segment Violation.

Module affected: g_game.c


3. Weapon Ownership
-------------------

Changed the IDFA cheat so you can't own weapons that aren't in the version
of the game you're playing. Shareware status bar was showing plasma rifle
and BFG after IDFA.

Module affected: st_stuff.c



02/24/98

1. Added key_hud
----------------

Changed the name of the key_define config variable to key_hud since the
F5 key brings up the HUD now.


2. Weapon recoil
----------------

Added weapon recoil, including recoil during refire, which is when you
hold down the fire key. There are different recoil values for each
weapon, determined by experiment. The recoil is applied at the point
where the 'muzzle blast' appears rather than at the point where the key
is pressed, due to the slight delay when firing the BFG.

This is wrapped by #define RECOIL, as well as a weapon_recoil config switch.


3. Varying friction
-------------------

A certain amount of friction is applied to player movement so he slows
down in a realistic way. By decreasing the friction applied, we can
simulate an icy floor. By increasing it, we can simulate mud or sludge
or magnetic floors. Two new 'special sector' values, 18 and 19 are used;
18 for less friction, 19 for more. When the player enters such a sector,
the friction value changes. In all other sectors, the old friction value
is used. Friction is not applied when the player is in the air. Friction 
_is_ applied if the player is walking across other Things when that is
allowed.

On both types of floors, 'getting started' is slowed down slightly, to
simulate getting your footing.

Future: apply varying friction to monster movement.

This is wrapped by #define FRICTION, as well as a variable_friction
config switch.


4. Wall bouncing
----------------

On an icy floor, the player can bounce off of walls if the angle of
approach is less than 45 degrees from the wall's normal. If greater than
45 degrees, the player will slide along the wall. Some momentum is lost
during the bounce, and you'll get the 'ooof' sound.

Future: if the player's speed is large enough, some damage is possible.

This is wrapped by #define FRICTION, as well as a variable_friction
config switch.


5. Push
-------

A new 'special sector' 20 allows for a 'water current' or 'wind' effect.
This is applied whether the player is on the ground or in the air.

There are two types of push that can be applied:

    a) constant push across the sector

    b) push emanating from a point in the sector, or drawing the player
       toward a point in the sector

A new Thing, MT_PUSH, has been created. Place one in a sector 20 and the
code looks at the MT_PUSH's flags (options) to determine which type of
push is being applied. Bits 8->10 give the push magnitude, (values 0->7).
If bit 11 is set, then it's a type b) push, otherwise it's type a). For a
type a) push, the Thing's angle gives the push direction. For a type b) push,
if bit 12 is set, the player is pulled toward the push point, otherwise
he's pushed away.

Type a) push force is constant across the sector.

Type b) push force diminishes linearly as you get farther from the point
source.

This effect can be used to create wind tunnels or water currents, ala Quake.

Future: apply push to monsters.

Future: if the floor is a liquid, don't apply push when the player is off
the ground. (No water current in the air, eh?)

Future: Type b) push force could diminish exponentially.

This is wrapped by #define PUSHERS, as well as a allow_pushers config switch.


6. Sprite Height
----------------

THIS FEATURE IS A PHASE II ITEM. IT'S DISABLED FOR PHASW I BETA!

a) Added the ability to jump over a blocking Thing if your feet are above the
top of the Thing.

You can now stop while above a Thing, which means that you're standing
on top of it. This allows for using Things as stepping stones, or sitting
on the head of a monster. Walking across Things takes on the same
height-checking that takes place when moving up or down steps. Friction is
also applied, as if you were on the ground.

Special sector damage (i.e. lava) doesn't happen when you're perched atop a
Thing sitting in the sector. A push force in your sector may affect you.

Allowing this meant that the Thing heights needed to be corrected. In
ID's code, Thing heights weren't always right, but it didn't matter much.
Now, whenever the code initializes height for a spawned Thing, it will either
use the old value (in compatibility mode) or a new value (in non-compatibility
mode).

Added two new fields to mobj_t: above_thing, which points to the mobj_t
of the thing you're above, and below_thing, which points to the mobj_t
of the thing you're below.

Added special 'saving/loading game' code for these new fields following
Lee's example.

b) Added the ability to move under a blocking Thing if your head is below the
bottom of the Thing.

Everything is wrapped by #define OVER_UNDER, as well as an over_under
config switch.

WARNING: THIS FEATURE IS INCOMPLETE! IT HAS BUGS! IT IS HERE FOR OTHERS
TO EXAMINE.


02/21/98

1. Screen clear

Minor change: added screen clear and color band at startup. This is
commented out until after beta.

Addendum (2/24) : this might have been overwritten on purpose by Lee. Have to
see where to put it back in.


02/20/98

1. Initial sprite translucency

Added preliminary ability to draw translucent sprites. This requires
the presence of tranmap.wad. This has one lump, TRANMAP, which
contains tranmap[256][256], where

        tranmap[i][j] = index of best matching color for Rk,Gk,Bk where

                        Rk = (Ri + Rj)/2
                        Gk = (Gi + Gj)/2
                        Bk = (Bi + Bj)/2

This means the painted color is the average of the existing color
and the new color. Averaging RGB values simulates translucency.

I copied R_DrawColumn, changed the copy's name to R_DrawTLColumn, and added the
changes at the point where the pixels are drawn. This keeps the
decision-making about translucency at a higher level, so as not to impact
performance more than necessary.

I wrote a program tranfilt.exe to create TRANMAP. It's in the
boomutil directory under my home directory on the server. Use its output
with WinTex to create the lump.

I added a config-file option "translucency". There's been some talk about
being able to turn this on/off generally for performance reasons. If we
decide not to have any default translucent Things (see below) we can remove
this later.

I added a TNTTRAN cheat code to turn translucency on or off for testing. I added
an MF_TRANSLUCENT bit to the p_mobj.h file to indicate that a sprite is
translucent, and modified several Thing definitions in info.c to make them
translucent. (I.e. imp, smoke, BFG blast, etc.) Look for MF_TRANSLUCENT. 
These should be modified later when we decide which Things _should be_
translucent by default, if any (i.e. not imps). For Things that can be
seen during a level-editing session (i.e. imps) we'll need a way to turn
translucency on/off.

This work is preliminary, and does not handle translucent textures. The 
solution there may be slightly different, and is a Phase II or III project.

1. User-defined keys (bindings)

ALL KEYS that trigger some action can now be defined in the config file.
Running BOOM with no config file will give you the key_* strings that can
be remapped. You're going to need a SETUP program though unless you
learned key codes in 4th grade. Now you can map your roommate's weapon
keys to garbage while he's asleep.

Here are all the keys that can be remapped. If you can think of any I
missed, let me know. (A few of these were already there.)

    key_weapon9          '9'

2. New weapon toggle key

The 0 (zero) key can be used to toggle between your most preferred
weapons that still have ammo. The key always chooses 'the most preferred
weapon other than the one that's showing, that still has ammo'. Don't
like my key choice? See #1 above.

3. SSG

The SSG now _really_ comes up when you hit the '9' key. I had to extend
BT_WEAPONMASK from 3 bits to 4 to enable this.

4. New Quick Reverse key

The '/' key will give you that quick 180-degree turn like mouse players
can execute.

5. Caps Lock is now Autorun

The Caps Lock key toggles you in and out of Autorun. As Jim told me, it's
like hiring someone to hold down the SHIFT key while you play. Good way
to put it.


01/30/98

1. Faster end-mission display text
----------------------------------

In compatibility mode, the end-mission text is displayed in its normal, slow
manner. In non-compatibility mode, the text comes up all at once.

2. Delimiter 0 bug in P_BlockLinesIterator in p_maputl.c
--------------------------------------------------------

The lines list carried in each block of the blockmap always starts with
a 0 and ends with a -1. These are the delimiters, and the linedef values
of lines that appear in a block are inserted between the 0 and the -1.
I.e. 0,330,332,-1 means that linedefs 330 and 332 appear in this block.
The code in P_BlockLinesIterator was treating the delimiting starting 0
as linedef 0 and applying whatever function was passed to it to this line.
I bumped the 'list' pointer ahead of time to get past the 0 delimiter
before applying the function. BTW, a block with linedef 0 in it looks like
0,0,n,...,-1.

(Later on, Lee wrapped it in the compatibility flag because it threw
the crusher demo out of sync. Go figure.)


01/28/98

1. Pain Elemental fires Lost Souls through blocking lines.
----------------------------------------------------------

A Pain Elemental can fire Lost Souls through impassable, monsters can't
cross, and one-sided lines. This is the cause of Lost Souls who are found
wandering outside the map.

I included a check of the trajectory intersecting these kinds of lines, and
disallow the Lost Soul spawn if the trajectory is blocked.

Also added a check to make sure the Lost Soul actually appears in a
legal space, i.e. isn't being spawned above the ceiling or below the
floor of its new sector.

Though this is a bug, it might break demos, so it has the
compatibility flag wrapped around it.

2. Pain Elemental can't shoot Lost Souls if >20 already present
---------------------------------------------------------------

Lee already removed this limit, but I extended the compatibility wrapper to
include the counting process.

3. Archvile creates ghosts
--------------------------

These are those nasty, can't kill w/o a rocket bounce guys that walk through
walls after Archie resurrects their door-crushed remains.

I suggest 3 options:

a. no change (compatibility mode)
b. resurrected monsters are killable and cannot walk through walls
   (bug fixed)
c. Archie ignores crushed monsters

Details:

When a monster dies, his new height is 1/4 his old height.

When a dead monster is crushed, he's turned into a GIB and given zero
height and zero radius.

When a monster is resurrected by Archie, Id multiplies the 'dead' height by
4 to restore it to normal. But if Archie's resurrecting a GIB, 4 times zero
is still zero. Id was also not restoring his radius.

So a ghost is a point-monster of zero height and width. He isn't killable
because you're always shooting over his head. Nearby rocket blasts killed
him because the blast radius code probably doesn't check height, just
existence w/in the radius.

To fix the bug, I restored the monster's height and radius at
resurrection time.

Everything else about him was ok. I also had to fix a check that Id had to
make sure the sector was tall enough to accept the resurrected monster.
This was done before the actual resurrection, and was using the GIB's zero
height, which always fit.


4. Added the TNTCOMP cheat code
-------------------------------

This toggles the compatibility flag on/off, for run-time checking of
compatibility-flag-wrapped code.
