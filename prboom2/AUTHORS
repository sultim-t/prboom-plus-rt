This file is now the amalgamated list of authors, contributors and credits
for LxDoom. Hopefully by keeping these all in one place, they will remain
more accurate.

Doom was originally written by id software; when playing with any id main
wad file, you can see their list of credits, which includes the list of
programmers. After some years, they released the source code, to allow
others to work on improving the game.

One of the first projects was DosDoom, by Chi Hoang. This was a quick port
of the released source code, which was for Linux, to DOS. This was then
picked up by TeamTNT (http://www.teamtnt.com/), who produced Boom, a greatly
debugged and extended version of Doom. The Boom programmers were Lee
Killough, Jim Flynn, Rand Phares, Ty Halderman.

LxDoom started as a port of Boom to Linux, by me, Colin Phipps
(cph@lxdoom.linuxgames.com). After porting the code to Linux, with the help
of the original released Linux-doom sources, I continued to add bug fixes and
features.

These included many things from MBF (Marine's Best Friend), a further enhanced
and debugged version of Boom, written by Lee Killough, and some ideas from
DosDoom (http://frag.com/dosdoom/).

In October 1999, id Software have re-released the Doom source code under the 
GNU General Public License. TeamTNT have also changed to the new license,
and the other sources mentioned above have all allowed their code to be
GPLed. So LxDoom is now covered by the GPL.

I'd like to thank TeamTNT for writing such a good engine, which has become
the basis for so many others. And I'd like to thank Lee Killough in
particular. His excellent coding in Boom made it easy to port to Linux and
indeed other architectures, and his further work in MBF was crucial in 
enabling me to improve LxDoom. Also thanks go to the DosDoom team.

My thanks also go to all the people below, who have contributed to or
otherwise helped LxDoom:

Gady Kozma	gady@math.tau.ac.il
Added hires to the SVGALib version of LxDoom, and other useful patches.

Dick Leban
Lots of feedback about portability issues and helping get the network code 
working properly back at v1.3.6.

Eduardo Casino Almao
Lots of helpful feedback and suggestions, but more importantly actually getting 
to grips with the code and giving very precise bug reports and patches.

Udo Monk
His port xdoom is very portable, and I referred to his code sometimes for help 
with the X stuff; also his collection of Doom tools (XWadTools) is the 
definitive tools collection for Linux.

Joey Hess
For numerous patches, like the glibc fixes and window manager updates, and
help with the music.

Andre Majorel	amajorel@teaser.fr
For Yadex, which drags Linux Doom editing back into this decade (well, last
few years anyway ;), and for the odd encouraging email.

Ben Winslow
Various useful patches, like the colour ENDOOM code.

Josh Parsons	josh@schlick.anu.edu.au
Sent me the patches to use autoconf for configuring LxDoom.

Michael Heasley	
Author of musserver, which helped me first add music support.

Rafael Reilova		
Took over the musserver program, made it much better, and mainly saved me 
having to worry about it anymore :-).

Steve Van Devender <stevev@efn.org>
Found the bug causing slight noise at the start of sounds playing, and other
patches.

Barry Mead <bmead@surfree.com>
Improvements to the mouse code.

Mattias Kunkel <mattias@kunkel.freeservers.com>
Made the lxdoom.spec file for creating LxDoom RPMs.

Frederic Oghdayan
For useful feedback on LxDoom v1.0.1, and repeating his bug reports until I 
believed them :-).

Vicente Aguilar	vicente@hal.dhis.org
His handy patch convinced me to keep on with making LxDoom a nicer UNIX style 
program.

Benjamin L McGee <vuelto@netscape.net>
Patch fixing the joystick code.

James "Quasar" Haley	
Ever willing to talk about source ideas; mentioned some Boom/MBF bugs to me, 
which I was then able to fix in LxDoom.

Everyone who contributed indirectly to MBF and Boom and Doom; see the
respective documentation files.

Everyone who brings us Linux, the best and cheapest OS around.

If you sent me patches for LxDoom which were included, and I forgot to
list you, I apologise. Please email me and I will add you. I have only
just collected these credits together into a single file, something I
should have done long ago, and I probably forgot many people.
