Installation From CVS
=====================

If you intend to compile PrBoom from a source tar file, such as
prboom-2.4.7.tar.gz, as opposed to CVS, skip to the "Basic Installation"
section.

  1. Install and configure deutex.  If deutex is already installed and
     configured skip to step 2.
        a. Install deutex from http://www.teaser.fr/~amajorel/deutex
        b. Set the DOOMWADDIR environment variable to the directory that
           contains the IWAD files:
              export DOOMWADDIR=/usr/local/share/games/doom

  2. 'cd' to a suitable parent directory for the PrBoom distribution:
        cd /usr/local/src

  3. Extract the PrBoom distribution from CVS:
        cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.prboom.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/prboom login
        cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.prboom.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/prboom co prboom2

  4. 'cd' to the directory containing the PrBoom distribution (the directory
     this file is in):
        cd prboom2

  5. Run the 'bootstrap' script in order to create the 'configure' script.
        ./bootstrap
     If you get this error:
        aclocal: configure.in: 153: macro `AM_PATH_SDL' not found in library
     Then you have to locate sdl.m4 and copy it to ./autotools/sdl.m4 in your
     prboom directory.

  6. If the 'configure' script was created by step 5 then proceed to the
     "Basic Installation" section.

Basic Installation
==================

  1. To compile PrBoom, you need the SDL development headers and libraries
     installed (SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_net). See
     http://prboom.sourceforge.net/linux.html for information on downloading
     the right libraries for your system.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the PrBoom distribution (the directory
     this file is in).

     Type `./configure' to configure PrBoom for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  3. Type `make' to compile PrBoom. This may take some time; while it's
     compiling I suggest you read the README, or maybe go and look for some
     good doom levels to play when it's finished :-).

     This should work on all Linux systems, but systems that have a make
     utility other than GNU make may have problems. E.g. you might need to
     install GNU make, and then use it instead of make for these
     instructions. I have tested BSD pmake and it works fine.

  4. Type `make install-strip' as root, to install the programs, data files
     and man pages for PrBoom. If you don't have root access on the machine,
     you should ask the syadmin to do this and the next step for you.

  5. Copy your Doom, Doom 2, Ultimate Doom or Final Doom IWAD (doom.wad or
     doom2.wad) to /usr/local/share/games/doom/ (or symlink it from there).
     Or if you don't have any of those, use the shareware IWAD, which you can
     get from http://www.doomworld.com/ or http://www.idsoftware.com/.

     If you have a system with many users, you should read the license for
     your version of Doom, and make sure only those users allowed to use it
     can access the IWAD file.

  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

  7. PrBoom is now ready for use. If /usr/local/games is in your path,
     you can just run prboom; otherwise give the full path.

     See the README file for information about getting the Timidity
     patches needed for music support, and more.

Building an RPM
===============

If you are on a system which uses the RPM packaging format, you might prefer
to build an RPM containing the PrBoom binaries rather than installing them
directly. Follow steps 1 and 2 above, then run a "make rpm". This performs
the usual proceedure for building the rpm in /usr/src/redhat/. Note that
the RPM sets its own parameters to ./configure; if you want to override
them you'll have to edit the build scripts yourself. Note that to get the
correct permissions, you either have to run this process as root, or use the
wrapper program fakeroot (version 0.4.5 or later - grab it from the Debian
source archive) and make sure you have permissions to the RPM build area.

Installation Details
====================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
