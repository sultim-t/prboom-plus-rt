-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is a log of all the changes to LxDoom since v1.0.0.
Note that LxDoom v0.* was a seperate line of development.

* Changes from v1.4.4 to the PrBoom merger
- Fix rare demo sync problem (LxDoom v1.4.x bug, only noticed on Memento
 Mori DEMO3)
- Fix memory management bugs
  - Memory wasted by bug in Z_FreeTags (original Doom bug)
  - Store correct size in extra memory blocks (Boom/MBF bug, harmless
   except when debugging)
  - Fix level precaching
    - Disabled by default, controlled by config file
    - Fix needlessly locked lumps (bug since LxDoom v1.3.2)

* Changes v1.4.3 to v1.4.4
- Install documentation in the right directory
- Sound code cleanup
- Fix problem with network games often desyncing immediately at startup

* Changes v1.4.2 to v1.4.3
- Improved mouse resolution, thanks to a patch from Barry Mead
- Various robustness fixed to the networking code
- Fixed various build problems
  - gcc 2.7.2 compile problems fixed
  - uid_t problems on odd systems should be fixed

* Changes v1.4.1 to v1.4.2
- Fixed various build problems, including
  - Networking not work on many systems
  - Portability improvements, in particular for Sparc
  - Autoconf getting confused on systems with X headers in the include path
- Fix bug with music not looping after being unpaused
- Misc minor improvements

* Changes v1.4.0 to v1.4.1
- Fixed occasional tutti fruiti on non-power-of-2 short textures
- Fixed minor bug in the WAD autoloading code
- Fixed the function keys in lsdoom, thanks to a patch from Chris Purnell
- Fixed all compile warnings with the new gcc

* Changes v1.3.7 to v1.4.0
- License is now the GNU General Public License, see COPYING.
- autoconf based setup makes compiling LxDoom simple on most systems;
  automatically compiles only the versions and features your system
  supports.
- Fixed rendering bugs:
  - tall vertical shafts did not block vision on the automap, and on x86
    systems there could be crashes in the column rendering near such shafts (
    bug from original Doom).
  - fixed slowdown caused by non-power of 2 height textures in the case
    where they don't tile (i.e. almost all cases) (this was the tutti-fruiti
    "fix" from Boom, I've "fixed the fix" in a sense)
  - fixed a slight slowdown caused by a bad optimisation (an old LxDoom bug)
- Fixed bug where things were rendered brighter in high-res, depending on the
  resolution (bug from PRBoom).
- Improvements to the sound code:
  - Fixed noise at the start of sounds playing (thanks to Steve Van Devender).
  - LxDoom detects the music or sound server exiting (alright, so I mean
    crashing ;-) and stops sending more data.
- Performance improvements, including:
  - New algorithm in P_GroupLines, saves seconds when loading big levels.
- Fixed problems with the networking code, where multihomed machines could
  get the wrong IP registered with the server.
- Screen code improvements:
  - Rewrote screen layout logic, fixing numerous bugs.
  - Fixed bug with flipped patches in high-res that could cause crashes,
    thanks to Gady Kozma.
  - Independent x and y scaling of the status bar, by Gady Kozma.
- Added warning messages whenever LxDoom auto-corrects errors in buggy
  PWADs. Also made -devparm cause LxDoom to initialise all textures at
  startup, so all texture errors are found at once.
- Store config files and save games in ~/.lxdoom/ instead of the current
  directory, removed the -cdrom parameter.
- Fixed Doom bug where the "got a medikit you REALLY needed" message was
  never used. Thanks to James "Quasar" Haley for pointing that one out.
- Made the numeric keypad keys be treated differently from their normal
  equivalents, so you can bind them to different actions.
- Fixed bad importing of mobj pointer reference code from MBF.
- The level completed screen is now shown after ExM8 levels in Doom 1/
  Ultimate Doom.
- Minor coop improvements:
  - Total game time shown on the intermission screen, as for single player
  - Quicksave enabled
- Removed the frame rate dots, instead I added a cheat code "IDRATE" to show
  various rendering stats, including the frame rate.
- Fixed the intermission screen code to store its data right (bad code from
  original Doom).

* Changes v1.3.6 to v1.3.7
- Client-server style net-games, including new server program
- LxDoom starts faster, thanks to an idea borrowed from DosDoom
- Player colours system sorted out, now your personal player colour is part of
  your player preferences.
- Fix for problems with 24bpp screens, new option in config file to deal with
  this.
- Fix key setup problems where certain choices of key setup could hinder
  message typing in multi-player.
- Misc stuff

* Changes v1.3.5 to v1.3.6
- Hires for the SVGALib version
- Automap rotation/overlay
- Modified to work with the new musserver
- Various misc improvements

* Changes v1.3.4 to v1.3.5
- Fixed nasty overflow in I_GetTime_RealTime, causing hangs
- Removed a load of I_GetTime references in m_menu.c
- Added support for music pausing/unpausing

* Changes from v1.3.3 to v1.3.4
- More MBF features/improvements imported:
  - Internal improvements (mobj pointer reference counting)
  - Enhanced skies support
- Status bar scaling for high-res
- Bug fixes:
  - Occasional corrupt save-games in large levels fixed (Boom/MBF bug)
  - -loadgame crashes fixed
- Performance improvements
- Command line argument parsing logic changed for convenience in shell scripts
  (later arguments take precedence)

* Changes from v1.3.2 to v1.3.3
- Optimised i386 assembly some more, about 2% improvement in fps
- Tested to compile and run on FreeBSD
- Modified #includes to use current headers
- Updated makefile hints for FreeBSD compiling
- Made install script more portable

* Changes from v1.3.1 to v1.3.2
- Imported/added some MBF features
  - New code pointers added
  - "Faster" sprite sorting
  - Improved Dehacked handling (more reliable, Dehacked-in-a-PWAD)
  - Fractional floor attributes saved in save-games
  - Auto-correction of common errors in wads
- Massive internal improvements, making LxDoom more stable - WAD lump locking,
  rewritten patch drawing code.
- Improved config file handling - now accepts (and writes out selected) numbers
  in hex, entries are sorted into sections with headers, and internally the
  handling is better.
- Portability improvements - LxDoom is now near-completely endian-corrected, so it
  should be compilable on big-endian machines, read the little endian Doom data
  files fine, and even network with other machines regardless of endianness.
  Also lots of misc portability stuff, explicitly signing some variables, a
  lot more stuff made const, etc. The only problem I think is that save-games aren't
  yet interchangeable across endiannesses.
- More memory efficient - block memory allocator reduces memory fragmentation,
  video buffers allocated only when needed, more things made constant and
  initialised better.
- Imported bug fixes from MBF:
  - File handle leak in translucency code
  - Water sector sprite problems
  - No chat in demo playback
  - Archville fire spawn
  - Scroller calculations overflow
  - Fast shots going through walls
  - Improved d_deh.c fixed numerous SIGSEGV's and error code bugs
  - Zombie players exiting levels
  - New thing flags caused incompatibility with buggy Doom wads
  - Setup menu backspace
  - Indigo/Brown default chat keys reversed
- Glide (3dfx) frame-buffer target (warning - released only in source code form and
  only for alpha testing purposes, not ready for normal use).
- Improved ENDOOM support - (optional) colour ENDOOM display, non-ASCII
  characters displayed, sensible choice between ENDOOM and ENDBOOM (displays
  any from a PWAD in preference, randomly chooses otherwise).
- Minor improvements so LxDoom integrates more naturally into UNIX systems; sound
  and music server are now searched for via the path, and wads are looked for in
  /usr/local/games/wads/ if no DOOMWADDIR is set.
- More keys work in the SVGALib version (notably PAUSE).
- Monster-monster kills in coop are assigned to the player the monster was
  targeting, or a random player if it wasn't targeting any, so coop
  monster kills stats total 100% at the end-level screen.
- Total game time is displayed on the intermission screens. This is a simple
  total of the times shown on the end-level screens so far this game, not
  including intermission times, and accurate to 1/35 of a second.
- Low sound volume fixed.
- Multi-player colours selectable in the config file.
- Misc minor fixes and improvements inspired by MBF:
  - Support for -noload parameter
  - Support auto-loading of deh/BEX files as well as wads
  - Removed limit on number of wad-files loaded.
  - Fixed buffer overrun in menu text writing code by wrapping long lines.

* Changes from v1.3.0 to v1.3.1
- Fixed saving of config file (bug affected most Linux systems)
- Binaries are now use libc.so.6.
- 24 bpp and 32 bpp true colour X displays are now supported (untested) (24
  bpp only supported for i386 systems).
- Auto-loading of wad files - in the config file there is a new option
  which lists wad files to be loaded automatically (several directories are
  searched as for IWADs).
- Loading saved games during a multi-player game now works. Very handy for
  coop games :).
- New config file option controls music pausing - when the game pauses
  the music can either continue or be stopped. So people playing at home can
  have the music continue while they read the map; people playing at work
  can pause when the boss comes in and have the music stop ;).
- Several more variables added to config file, most notably the
  default size of the LxDoom window (for high-res).
- PRBoom v2.02 networking code is now used. It still doesn't network with
  PRBoom though. Net games with just LxDoom work fine still. Anyone with ideas
  why it won't go with PRBoom let me know.
- If saving a demo/screen-shot/save-game to disk fails an error message is
  displayed. One of the most frustrating features of all versions of Doom that I
  have used is that they always say "Game Saved" even if you are
  out of disk space and it didn't save. I'm glad to have this one fixed.
- Fixed the -cdrom parameter.
- Fixed makefile hints for FreeBSD.
- Fixed music pausing causing musserver crash.
- Documentation updates.

* Changes from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0
- Hi-res added to X-windows version
- Portability improvements (FreeBSD and RISC stuff in the makefile, minor code
  changes included)
- Minor bug-fixes

* Changes from v1.1.1 to v1.2.0
- Boom v2.02 updates incorporated (see TeamTNT's site for info on that)
- Improved music comms code, to pass instruments and volume info
- Code reorganisation & tweaking; video code is more logically organised,
  and SVGALib code is neater now.

* Changes from v1.1.0 to v1.1.1
- Fixed crash using -warp parameter with SVGALib version
- Fixed music server communication code
- Should compile using glibc

* Changes from v1.0.1 to v1.1.0
- SVGALib version
- Fixed timing problem on buggy kernels causing crashes in the wipe screens
- Fixed bug in sound server communications which prevented Doom 1 working
- Fixed problem with sound code causing accelerated sound on v2.1.125 kernel
- Removed need for IPC in sound server communications, used pipe instead
- Improved mouse grabbing/ungrabbing code in XFree86 version, now depends on
  game and window status
- Improved TrueColor/DirectColor 16 bpp support
- X version is more multitasking friendly - detects when it is hidden or paused
  or an intermission screen is up, and tries to free some more CPU time.

* Changes from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1:
- 16 bpp colour modes now supported. If you use a 16 bpp colour mode (65
  thousand colours approx.), then you don't have to change your X setup to 256
  colours (8 bpp) before using lxdoom anymore. However, it is still a good idea
  to use 256 colours, because it is faster that way.
- fixed a minor bug in routine used for the 8 bpp '-2' option (screen
  doubling), which caused a couple of lines to be missed at the bottom of the
  display window.
- fixed a Boom bug which caused crashes in multi-player games. The bug occurred
  when, during a single game session, first the players played one level at
  which someone died, and then later exited that level, and later still another
  player died. I.e in a multilevel death-match, or a long coop game. Caused one
  machine to exit lxdoom with 'Segmentation Violation'. The version of PRBoom I
  have also exhibits these symptoms, though obviously I can't be sure that this
  is the cause; Boom v2.0 and v2.01 had this bug.
