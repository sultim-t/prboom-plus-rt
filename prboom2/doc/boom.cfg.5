.SH NAME
boom.cfg \- Configuration file for LxDoom v1.3.2 onwards
.SH USAGE
When a version of LxDoom (that is lxdoom, lsdoom, or other port of LxDoom) is run, it 
searches for this configuration file to modify its default settings. Every time 
LxDoom exits, it rewrites the configuration file, updating any settings that have 
been changed using teh in-game menues.
.PP
LxDoom expects the config file to be  ~/.lxdoom/boom.cfg. Alternatively, it 
can be made to look elsewhere by using a command-line parameter:
.PP
.B {lxdoom,lsdoom}
[ \-config \fImyconf\fR ]
.SH FORMAT
boom.cfg consists of a number of variables and values. Each line is of the following 
format:
.PP
[
{ 
{{#,;,[}
.I comment_text
,
.I variable 
{\fIdecimal_integer\fR, 0x\fIhex_integer\fR, "\fIstring_text\fR"}}]
.PP
Any line beginning with a non-alphabetic character is treated as a comment and 
ignored; for future compatibility you should start comments with a #, ; or [. 
Note however that when LxDoom rewrites boom.cfg it does not preserve user added 
comments.
.PP
Any line beginning with an alphabetic character is treated as a variable-value pair. 
The first word (sequence of non-whitespace characters) is the variable name, and 
everything after the following block of whitespace is taken to be the value 
assigned to the variable.
.PP
Variables not recognised by LxDoom, or which are given an invalid value or a value 
of an inappropriate type, are ignored. Warning messages are given where relevant.
.PP
The variables recognised by LxDoom are described per-section in the following 
sections. The sections are informal however; when LxDoom rewrites the config file 
it writes in section headings and puts variables into the relevant sections, but 
when reading these are ignored.

.SH MISC SETTINGS
.TP
compatibility_level
LxDoom is capable of behaving in a way compatible with earlier versions of Doom and 
Boom/PrBoom. The value given here selects the version to be compatible with when 
doing new games/demos (loading savegames and playing back demos automatically 
selects the level of compatibility that was played with). The current values are: 
0=Doom v1.9 (bugs and all), 
1=Boom's compatibility mode (Doom v1.9 but without most of the bugs), 
2=Boom v2.02 (TeamTNT's popular DOS port of Doom, on which LxDoom is based), 
3=LxDoom v1.3.2+ (most bug fixes and features).
.TP
realtic_clock_rate
Selects the speed that LxDoom runs at, as a percentage of normal game speed. 
Leave at 100 unless you want to experiment. Note that it is considered 
`cheating' to use this at any setting below 100 (or above?).
.TP
max_player_corpse
Sets the maximum number of player corpses to leave lying around. If this limit would 
be exceeded, an old corpse is removed. Useful for big/long Deathmatch games, where the 
sheer number of corpses could slow the game down.
.TP
demo_insurance
Selects a method of protecting demos against `going out of sync' (where the 
player seems to lose control and behave madly, but in fact the players 
original instructions as stored in the demo have got out of sync with the 
game he was playing). 0=No protection, 1=Full protection, 2=Only while 
recording demos. Safest when left set to 2.
.TP
endoom_mode
This parameter specifies options controlling the display of the credits screen 
when Doom exits. Currently it is the sum fo 3 options: add 1 for colours, 2 for 
non-ascii characters to be displayed, and 4 for the last line to be skipped so the 
top line doesn't scroll off screen.
.TP
level_precache
If set, when loading a new level LxDoom precaches all the graphics the level
is likely to need in memory. This makes it much slower to load the level,
but reduces disk activity and slowdowns reading data during play. Most
systems are fast enough that precaching is not needed.

.SH FILES SETTINGS
.TP
auto_load
A semicolon-separated list of .wad, .deh and .bex files to load 
automatically when LxDoom is started. 
Currently LxDoom searches the current directory, your home directory, and the 
directory pointed to by the DOOMWADDIR environimental variable for these files.

.SH GAME SETTINGS
.TP
default_skill
The default skill level when starting a new game.
.TP
weapon_recoil
Enables recoil from weapon fire.
.TP
player_bobbing
Enables player bobbing (view randomly moving up/down slightly as the player
runs).
.TP
monsters_remember
Makes monsters remember their previous enemy after killing their current
target.
.TP
sts_always_red
LxDoom makes the colour of the text displays on the status bar reflect your
current status (red=low, yellow=average, green=good, blue=supercharged).
This option, if set, disables this behavior, returning to the original Doom
behavior of displaying the numbers in red always, which is slightly faster.
.TP
sts_pct_always_gray
See above, this makes just the percent signs always gray, instead of
changing colour.
.TP
sts_traditional_keys
Doom and LxDoom have two types of keys; LxDoom will normally display both keys 
of a given colour if you have both. This option, if enabled, instead makes
LxDoom only ever display one key of each colour, in the same way Doom did.
.TP
traditional_menu
Changes LxDoom's menu ordering to be the same as original Doom if enabled.
.TP
show_messages
When enabled, text messages are displayed in the top left corner of the screen
describing events in the game. Can be toggled in the game, this is just to
preserve the setting.
.TP
autorun
Makes the player always run, without having to hold down a run key. Can be
toggled in the game, this just preserves the setting.

.SH SOUND SETTINGS
.TP
sound_card
Selects whether sound effects are enabled (non-zero enables). For compatibility reasons 
with Boom, a range of values are accepted.
.TP
music_card
Selects whether in-game music is enabled (non-zero enables). For compatibility reasons 
a range of values are accepted.
.TP
pitched_sounds
If enabled by this variable, this enables `pitching' (making pitch adjustments to the 
playing sounds) for 16 bit sound cards.
.TP
sfx_volume
Sound effects volume. This is best adjusted in the game.
.TP
music_volume
Music volume. This is best adjusted in the game. 
.TP
mus_pause_opt
Selects what LxDoom does to the music when a games is paused. 0=stop the music, 
1=pause the music (stop it playing, but when resumed resume it at the same 
place - not implemented), 2=continue playing.
.TP
soundsrv
Selects the program to try to execute as an external sound server, without 
which no sound effects can be played. The only program I know of to do this is 
the supplied sound server (sndserv) with LxDoom, so enter its path here if 
needed.
.TP
musicsrv
Selects the program to try to execute as an external music server, without 
which no in-game music can be played. The only program I know of to do this 
is the program lxmusserver, linked from the LxDoom site, so enter its path 
here if needed.
.TP
sounddev
The device to which sound effects are sent. This must be a device compatible 
with /dev/dsp on UNIX systems. For example, to play LxDoom's sound effects 
through the PC speaker driver for Linux v2.0.x, change this entry to 
/dev/pcsp16.
.TP
snd_channels
The number of channels of audio that LxDoom is to manage simultaneously. Note 
that this is separate from the sound server which maintains its own limits, so 
this is probably irrelevant to UNIX ports of LxDoom.

.SH VIDEO SETTINGS
.TP 
screen_width, screen_height
For versions of LxDoom which support high-res, these specify the default 
screen or window size for LxDoom. These settings are ignored and preserved by 
versions of LxDoom which do not do high-res (they assume 320x200).
.TP
use_vsync
For versions of LxDoom that have access to the hardware at this low a level, 
this tells LxDoom to wait to update the screen until a vertical retrace of
the CRT screen. This means that the screen is updated while nothing is being 
drawn, giving a smoother animation and faster redraws. However it does lower 
the framerate.
.TP
translucency
Causes LxDoom to display certain objects as translucent.
.TP
tran_filter_pct
Selects how translucent objects are when they are translucent. Play with this 
and see for yourself.
.TP
screenblocks
Selects a reduced screensize inside the LxDoom window (the player's view is 
surrounded by a border). Normally this is undesirable, but it can help speed 
up the game. Can be changed in the game with the +/- keys, this variable is
just to preserve that setting.
.TP
usegamma
Selects a level of gamma correction (extra screen brightening) to correct for a 
dark monitor or light surroundings. Can be selected in the game with the F11 
key, this config entry preserves that setting.
.TP
X_options
Sets various misc options used by the Xwindows version, lxdoom. Default is 0; 
add 1 to disable MitSHM, add 2 to select alternate 24bpp code (use this if 
lxdoom has video corruption in 24bpp visuals).

.SH MOUSE SETTINGS
.PP
This section specifies settings for using a mouse with LxDoom. There are
several setings that control button bindings (what action each button causes
inthe game); these are easiest set from the in-game menus, these config
entries are to preserve the settings between games.
.TP
use_mouse
Enable or disable the use of a mouse with LxDoom.
.TP
mouse_sensitivity_horiz, mouse_sensitivity_vert
Sets the sensitivity of the mouse in LxDoom. Easier set from the in-game menus.

.SH KEY BINDINGS
.PP
These specify the keys that trigger various actions in LxDoom. The codes used 
for keys are internal to LxDoom, though many keys are represented by their 
ASCII codes. It is easiest to modify these via the in-game menus 
(OPTIONS->SETUP->KEY BINDINGS). These config file entries preserve the
settings from this menu between game sessions.

.SH JOYSTICK SETTINGS
.PP
There are the trigger variables here, which are calculated during joystick 
calibration (the values received from the kernel driver outside of which 
movement is caused in the game). Also there are the button-bindings, again 
best adjusted using the in-game menus.
.TP
use_joystick
This selects the number of the joystick to use, or 0 selects no joystick. You 
have to have the relevant device files (/dev/js0 etc) and the kernel driver 
loaded.

.SH CHAT MACROS
.PP
These are pre-written text strings for quick transmission to players in a 
network game (consult your Doom documentation). Easiest set via the in-game 
menus (OPTIONS->SETUP->CHAT MACROS).

.SH AUTOMAP SETTINGS
.PP
These are settings related to the automap. These are easiest set from 
within the game.

.SH HEADS_UP DISPLAY SETTINGS
.PP
These are settings related to the heads-up display, that is messages received 
while playing and the heads-up display of your current status obtained by 
pressing + while the view is full-screen in LxDoom. See the Boom documentation 
for details. All controlled best from within the game.

.SH WEAPON PREFERENCES
.PP
Here are the settings from the Weapons menu in the game 
(OPTIONS->SETUP->WEAPONS). 

.SH ALSO SEE
lxdoom(6), LxDoom's documentation (including the Boom documentation) and your 
Doom documentation.
