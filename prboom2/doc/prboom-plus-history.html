<br><span class="ver">2.5.1.0</span>
<span class="date"> @ 2011-May-28</span>
<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New music code by Nicholai Main. See "Preferred MIDI player" GUI option. Available values are "sdl", "fluidsynth" (disabled for Win9x), "opl2" and "portmidi".
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>If "-warp" doesn't have a map number after it, the game will automatically warp to the first map in all the files loaded at the command line.  This allows a pwad to be run without concerns about where its actual maps start.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>The option to place the overlaid automap <a href="img/prboom-plus/overlay-automap.png">where you want</a> (map_overlay_pos_x/y/width/height config variables).
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added render_patches_scalex/y config variables for custom scaling when "not adjusted" is used.

<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Alt-Enter now toggles between fullscreen and windowed modes.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added an "Use GL surface for software mode" video option. It renders a software surface into an OpenGL surface. Thus, you shouldn't have palette issues on modern systems and you can use VSync even with the "windib" SDL video driver.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New video capture system by Nicholai Main. Use command line params "-timedemo anydemo.lmp -viddump filename.mkv"; see usage.txt for more details.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Added mouse button actions for "backward motion" and for single-click "use".
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>The noclip effect which can occur with an "intercepts overflow" should not take effect after a level is reloaded.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>When recording, the ENDOOM screen is now disabled regardless of the misc_fastexit option.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>The "Fast Exit" option is now named "Show ENDOOM screen".
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>The precise rendering of automap lines when "render quality" is "quality" to avoid small vibrations during map rotation. Applied only in GL mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Antialiasing of automap lines now also works in software modes (Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm). There's a map_use_multisamling config variable and a corresponding GUI entry for this.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed a crash on map21 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=16238">newgothic.wad</a> with "-complevel 10" and higher.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Improved emulation of "missed back side" overruns. The desynch in <a href="http://doomedsda.us/wad1490.html">fez1-924.lmp @ fez1.wad</a> is gone now, but you still need to add "-setmem dosbox" or "-setmem dos71" command line parameter, because the default "dos622" memory layout causes a desynch.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The automap scaling factor is now saved.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>A "-set overrun_* = 0" setting now works in demo footers.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>When playing back multi-level demos for the Ultimate DOOM, -warp produced unexpected results when combined with -auto.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The titlepic in <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=1509">malgnant.wad</a> caused Signal 11 crashes.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed the incorrect positioning of automap marks when 'follow mode' and 'rotate mode' were enabled.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Automap marks did not draw correctly, displaying white rectangles instead of digits.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Automap marks did not scale to the selected screen resolution and were hardly visible at high resolutions as a result.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The skydome cap color was wrong during invulnerability mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The mouse cursor didn't hide during fullscreen when the mouse was disabled in General options.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>When one used skipsec to warp to an intermission screen portion of a demo, the music from the previous level was played instead of the intermission music.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The "flashing hom" detector didn't work in GL mode.

<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added support for textured automap. Available in the menu at "Options\Setup\Automap\Enable Textured Display".
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>"Next Level" key now works during normal play, and not just during demo playback.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added "-shotdir" command line switch and "screenshot_dir" config variable. Default folder for screenshots is now exe_dir.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Two new sponsored HUDs.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Added ability (overrun_missedbackside_emulate 1) to emulate wrong memory access for cases when some linedefs have a two-sided flag set, but no second sidedef. Fixed desynch on <a href="http://doomedsda.us/wad1005.html">CLNJ-506.LMP @ CHALLENJ.WAD</a>
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Broken BLOCKMAP lumps won't be recreated automatically. Use "-blockmap" command line switch if PrBoom-plus reports a buggy blockmap.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>The "-solo-net" and "-emulate x.y.z" params are saved to the demo footer.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Added frustum culling for sprites if mouse look is enabled (gl_sprites_frustum_culling). If you look up or down on nuts.wad with this, frame rate will increase instead of decreasing.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Improved compatibility with Doom 1.2. All known Doom 1.2 demos including <a href="http://doomedsda.us/767col159.html">ret12na.lmp @ return01.wad</a>, <a href="http://doomedsda.us/1082col215.html">wp2-33.lmp @ wadpak2.wad</a> and <a href="http://doomedsda.us/wad892.html">uac_dead demos</a> by Never_Again are now in sync.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>GLBDEFS alias for GLDEFS lump to avoid compatibility issues with other ports. Note that if GLBDEFS is present, GLDEFS will not be parsed at all.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Command-line added demos don't conflict with lump names anymore. For example, you can play map01.lmp back on map01.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Incorrect nodes on <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=4169">e1m1 @ deepcre.wad</a> don't crash PrBoom-plus anymore.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The title screen from the <a href="http://www.doomwadstation.com/main/dukegp.rar">Duke Nukem total conversion</a> PWAD didn't appear in software mode, being replaced by a black screen.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Pitch-shift emulation didn't work.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>On-screen graphics like PAUSE, M_DOOM, TITLEPIC, etc didn't fit in the screen at 16x9 aspect ratios and "not adjusted" mode for "status bar and menu appearance".
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed glitch in "no texture" mapping trick under invulnerability when using hires textures.
</table>

<br><span class="ver">2.5.0.7</span>
<span class="date">&nbsp;@&nbsp;2010-Aug-15</span>
<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added support for DeePBSP v4 extended nodes.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added support for ZDoom's uncompressed extended nodes.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Animation blending. (Options \ General \ Texture Options \ Blend Animations)
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Support for Quake2/Unreal style skyboxes. Their <a href="http://zdoom.org/wiki/GLDEFS#Skybox_definitions">definitions</a> (using GLDEFS lump) are GZDoom compatible.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Support for <a href="http://zdoom.org/wiki/MUSINFO">MUSINFO</a> lump (dynamic music changing) from Risen3D.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Support for custom per-texture detail textures. Syntax of definition using GLDEFS lump:
<pre class="code">
detail
{
  (walls | flats) [default_detail_name [width [height [offset_x [offset_y]]]]]
  {
    texture_name [detail_name [width [height [offset_x [offset_y]]]]]
  }
}
</pre>

Where detail_name is a bmp/png/tga/jpg/pcx/gif lump between the HI_START/HI_END markers. You don't need to add the texture to TEXTURES1.
Default values are (width:16 height:16 offset_x:0 offset_y:0)

<p>Example:
<pre class="code">
detail
{
  walls smooth01 32.0 //default detail for walls (width = 32, height = 16, offset_x/y = 0)
  {
    brick7  detstone 64.0 64 10.532
    brick8  detail02 // detail02 16 16 0 0
    water1 // do not apply default detail to water
    water2
    water3
    water4
  }
  flats // no default detail for flats
  {
    grass1 Grass01 32 32
    NUKAGE1 detslime 16 16 0 0 // different offsets for animated flats make sense
    NUKAGE2 detslime 16 16 4 4
    NUKAGE3 detslime 16 16 8 8
  }
}
</pre>
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Hacked SDL_mixer.dll to avoid music bugs on some tracks. (for example: music goes wrong from 1:15 with timidity on doom2.wad map05)
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Recalculates seg offsets that are sometimes incorrect with certain nodebuilders. Fixes among others, line 20365 of DV.wad, map 5. Makes sense only for software renderer.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Scan forward for a MUS header signature at the beginning of a MUS lump, which apparently DMX was capable of doing vis-a-vis DIESCUM.WAD.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Verifies blockmap validity and reports it in stdout.txt.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Disables sky texture scaling if the status bar is used.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>In Chex Quest, uses the radiation suit colormap instead of the red colormaps that are usually used when taking damage (or getting the berserk pack).  This matches Vanilla chex.exe behavior (from chocolate-doom).
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Make -complevel 9 draw the sky normally during invulnerability. This is what Boom does. It was MBF that introduced the "negative" sky option.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>No z-fighting in OpenGL mode for a killed mobj and its dropped weapon after death even with "sprites_doom_order 1".
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>The ability to render flats using draw lists. Can be noticeably faster on complex levels. "gl_use_display_lists" in config.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed HOM at sectors 226 and 300 on E1M1 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=1651">OTTAWAU.WAD</a>. Fix affects only vanilla compatibility levels, because Boom's behavior is different. Newtechn.wad is also fixed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed a -trace_thingshealth issue.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed a crash when demo footer and re-record are used.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Full path should not be stored in demo footer for Dehacked patches.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>SDL_mixer's native MIDI music playing does not pause properly. As a workaround, it sets the volume to 0 when paused and "mus_pause_opt 1".
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Boom colormaps are not be applied twice for hires textures anymore.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed the latest known incompatibility with MBF.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed an incompatibility with Win95.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>During demo playback when using the camera the sound was heard from the players position, instead of the camera position.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>After joining a game using recordfromto it was not possible to save the game.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Inheriting of friendlyness during spawn, for MBF compatibility.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>PrBoom did not use the misc1 and misc2 frame parameters in A_Mushroom for Boom compatibility. Normally those two should control the angle and speed factor of the fireballs, but it didn't happen here.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>"map_use_multisamling 0" did not work with "map_always_updates 0"
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed crash in software mode with 5x4 aspect.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed mismatches between sotware and GL modes at 5x4 aspect.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Walkcam did not interpolate when paused.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Color variables were misaligned in the automap settings menu with "not adjusted" format.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>A string of garbage from the title picture was left on the bottom of the HUD when using "not adjusted" format at resolutions with odd height (700x525 as example).
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed corruption of graphics after smoothing edges on systems with LP64 data model. Most Unix (like Solaris) and Unix-like systems (like Linux).

<br><span class="ver">2.5.0.6</span>
<span class="date">&nbsp;@&nbsp;2009-Dec-27</span>
<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added the ability to smooth sprites edges ("Options\General\OpenGL Options\Smooth Sprite Edges"). Might noticeably reduce frame rate. Includes a "gl_mask_sprite_threshold" config variable for the intensity of smoothing (0-100).
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Ability to see kills/secrets/items/time statistics in automap mode. Available in the menu at "Options\Setup\Automap\".
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added a "map_use_multisamling" config variable to apply multisampling to the automap.

<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added a "gl_shadows_maxdist" config variable.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added the ability to disable any OpenGL extension via the config instead of disabling all of them with "gl_compatibility" in case your drivers can't work properly with specific features. The extensions which can be disabled are: gl_arb_multitexture, gl_arb_texture_compression, gl_arb_texture_non_power_of_two, gl_ext_arb_vertex_buffer_object, gl_ext_blend_color, gl_ext_framebuffer_object, gl_ext_packed_depth_stencil, gl_ext_texture_filter_anisotropic, gl_use_stencil.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added a "-trace_givendamage" command line parameter to trace the latest and total damage inflicted by any specific monsters or players in a level. If a player is selected, its data will be tracked across multiple levels. Available with the Boom HUD only. Usage:
<pre class="code">
    -trace_givendamage ThingID [ThingID] [ThingID]
</pre>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added a "map_scroll_speed" cfg variable and GUI setting. "key_speed" doubles the speed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added a "sprites_doom_order" config variable for correct sprite sorting. See sectors 99, 115, and so on in Strain.wad map13, for example. This also fixes z-fighting between overlapped sprites in GL mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Mouselook key and keys bound to game speed change commands do not break cheats being typed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Midi volume is applied to all midi devices when mus_extend_volume is 1.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Light level 0 will now be truly lightless with GZDoom lighting mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Automap grid can now rotate with map (from ZDoom).
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Now DSSECRET is used when a secret area is found, instead of DSITMBK. The new sound lump is part of prboom-plus.wad and can be replaced through PWADs.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed a crash in software mode at some resolutions when using 'Doom Format' or 'Fit to Width' for 'Status Bar and Menu Appearance'.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Now applies fake contrast when using "Fog Based" sector light mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed Player's weapon lighting, that was too dark in GL mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed small glitches on Boom HUD graphics in GL mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Mouse button now moves camera forward if you have it assigned to move forward.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed software mode bug: if you played a wad with menu graphics big enough to go over the status bar, entering and exiting the menu left a trace of the menu graphic over the status bar. See HR2final.wad, for example.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Flat bleeding on walls won't incorrectly bleed through walls and floors when motion blur is in effect anymore. This fix requires support of the "GL_EXT_packed_depth_stencil" extension.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Simple shadows and transparent textures don't sometimes flicker anymore when fog-based lighting is used.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Shadows don't disappear in some situations anymore.

PrBoom-Plus will check for a demo footer and if it is present, will read which IWAD, PWAD and DEH files were used for recording, will try to download necessary add-on files from the Internet and will play the demo for you.
  <p>Currently, PrBoom-Plus saves the following information (with demo_extendedformat 1):
    <ul>
      <li>VERSION - version of DemoEx format (1.0)
      <li>PORTNAME - port name and version (PrBoom-Plus 2.5.0.1)

<tr><td class="aaa">[!]</td><td>Updated to the latest prboom 2.4.8. (SVN build, revision 2423).
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New mouse code without SDL lags. Win32 mouse handling was removed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Boom colormaps are supported in OpenGL mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New mus -> mid conversion code thanks to Ben Ryves benryves@benryves.com This removes bugs and plays back a lot of music closer to Vanilla Doom - eg. tnt.wad map02.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Smooth movement: interpolation of weapon bobbing.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New command-line switch "-emulate prboom_ver" for emulation of old buggy behaviour of previous prboom versions during playback of doom\doom2\boom\mbf\lxdoom demos in cases where a prboom bug affects the demo compatibility and leads to desyncs in the original EXEs. Now you can specify only "-emulate 2.2.6" instead of set of -force_remove_slime_trails, -force_boom_brainawake, etc. For example, boom-incompatible demo by Anima Zero cc2lmps.zip\c215-uv.lmp recorded with prboom 2.2.4 in boom compatibility mode can be correctly viewed in newer versions with -emulate 2.2.4 or with -force_prboom_friction.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>PC Speaker emulation from chocolate-doom.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New command-line switch "-force_lxdoom_demo_compatibility" for emulation of all bugs in demo compatibility mode in lxdoom. There are no more desynchs on "Doom-incompatible" demos from DHT6 exams.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Ability to force -nomonsters and -respawn for playback of 1.2 demos. Demos recorded with Doom.exe 1.2 did not contain any information about whether these parameters had been used. In order to play them back, you should add them to the command-line for playback. There is no more desynch on <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=13976">mesh.lmp @ mesh.wad</a> (prboom -iwad doom.wad -file mesh.wad -playdemo mesh.lmp -nomonsters)

<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Kills percentage, if extremely high, was reported wrongly and could in theory lead to desyncs.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>PrBoom bug: Par times were not displayed. The program was viewing prboom(-plus).wad as a pwad, and therefore the piece of code that suppressed par times was always being triggered.

<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Move mouse sensitivity menu upwards a little to avoid overlap with status bar with accompanying visual glitches on software renderer.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The bug in the algorithm for splitting of a sector into closed contours was fixed. There is no more HOM at the starting area on MAP16 @ Eternal.wad in OpenGL. I hope nothing was broken.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Correction of an overflow in calculation of a sound origin on large levels. New code is applied only for non-compatible modes and with comp_sound equal to zero. There is no more bug with an absent sound after pressing the distant western switch on Hell Spirit (not released) by Alexander "Eternal" S.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Premature program exit during map26 in 4-player coop demo 29uv4p_*.lmp @ doom2.wad. This bug was introduced in r1458 by cph for 2.4.3 release.

<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Launcher: Autoselecting of wads according to the lmp file-name (using regular expressions)
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Two new compatibility options are added:
  <ul>
    <li>comp_ouchface - "Use Doom's buggy 'Ouch' face code"
    <li>comp_oofsound - "Dead players make 'oof' sound when landing"
  </ul>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New "-auto" command-line switch for autoloading of wads according to the lmp file-name.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>There are three modes of sprite clipping in opengl:
  <ul>
    <li>Constant - gl_sprite_offset used;
    <li>Always - if the sprite is below the floor, and it's not a hanger/floater/missile;

<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New "all-in-one" version that includes the resource wad and SDL files inside the exe.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Compatibility with common mapping errors "Pad a too short reject with zeros" was removed. Added new command line switch "-reject_pad_with_ff". PrBoom 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 padded a short REJECT with 0xff (ones) instead of zeros. This command-line switch may be needed for demos recorded with these versions of PrBoom on maps with a too short REJECT. For example: <a href="http://competn.doom2.net/pub/sda/d-h/equxlmps.zip">equ7-108.lmp</a>@<a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=14219">lwfirst.wad</a>.

<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Improved support for Doom v1.2:
  <ul>
    <li>Max Health Bonus = 199;
    <li>Max Armor = unlimited;
    <li>Max Soulsphere = 199;
    <li>Megasphere Health = 199 (there was no megasphere back then, but this seems consistent);

The bug was introduced in 2.4.x by cph. After some tests and disassembling I conclude that the implementation of A_BossDeath() in all compatible ports (PrBoom, Eternity, Chocolate-Doom) is totally wrong for doom2 compatibility.
